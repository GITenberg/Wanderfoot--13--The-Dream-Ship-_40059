<p class="pfirst">The <em class="italics">Bavaric</em> had been four fine September days
at sea, and it was time for the vague pain and
melancholy that always haunted Westenra after
leaving Ireland to pass; yet it stayed with him
as never before it had stayed.  The voice of the
Atlantic sang a dirge in his ears, and looking at
the long grey rollers he thought of his mother's
hair which he would never see again, of the mists
that enveloped <em class="italics">Inishaan</em> as Ireland passed from
sight, of the ghosts of Raths, and all grey things;
and life looked grey before him and dull.  It was
as though the mists and shadows of his land lay
upon his spirit and would not be lifted.  More
than ever he was lonely, more than ever an exile,
for now there was none but the dead left to him in
the land of his birth; the last root had gone, the
last frond been cut away.  His mother had died on
the day he sailed from New York to pay her his
annual visit, and long before he reached Queenstown
she had been laid away to rest by his father's
side in the fair valley of Glendalough.</p>
<p class="pnext">For awhile he had roamed about Ireland with
something of the aimlessness of a wounded
creature, choosing wild solitary places where the
sorrowful beauty of lake and forest and mountain,
so unique, so different in its wistful allurement to
any other scenery in the world, had seemed to
brood with him in his grief and lay with mysterious
hands some healing spikenard in his heart.  But
the shadow of loneliness had not been lifted from him.</p>
<p class="pnext">He had never spent more than a few weeks of
his yearly holiday with his mother, and the rest
of the two months in different parts of Europe, but
always he had felt her in his life; sitting by her
fireside in her beautiful little Carlow home she had
constituted his bit of Ireland, his share of the world.
Now he was a lonely man without home or kin.
The ache of emptiness was in his heart as he stared
at the few pale early stars that had ventured forth
into the evening sky.</p>
<p class="pnext">Nothing was left in his life now except a child
and a woman; but the child was not even his own,
and the woman was only a vision.  For years she
had come to him in his dreams, so many years that
he could not remember the first time, but usually
she appeared when he was in Ireland or coming
away from it, never in America; and because he
was fresh from Ireland, and the supernatural
element that is in the Celtic nature had been
recently renewed so that supernatural things still
seemed to him the real things of life, he thought of
her now as if she were a real woman, and wondered
why it was so long since he had seen her flickering
through the night in her pale grey gown with fine
lace at the throat and a chain of luminous beads
swinging before her neck.  He tried to recall
the strangely Oriental face, but, as always it
eluded him, and he could only remember the wistful
lurking sadness that divined in her something
of the Irishry, the knowledge of sorrow and longing
for far places in her eyes; the subtle suggestion
of mourning for some lost land, like an echo of
Goethe's song:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line">"Kennst Du das Land wo die Citronen blühn?</div>
<div class="line">Im dunkeln Laub die Goldorangen glühn,</div>
<div class="line">Ein sanfter Wind vom blauen Himmel weht</div>
<div class="line">Die Myrte, still und hoch der Lorbeer steht."</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="pfirst">There were other things that troubled him too:
dark shadows hovering about her, flecks of mud
and blood upon her bare feet, and the weary look
of one who has come a long way upon a bad road.
But what was sweet to his lonely heart was that
she seemed so unquestionably to belong to him,
so wholly and inevitably his.</p>
<p class="pnext">The Irish boy who never loved has never lived,
and Westenra cherished with characteristic ardour
the remembrance of one or two youthful romances,
but apart from these and his great love for his
mother there had been no woman's influence in
his life.  He had been too busy to let women in.</p>
<p class="pnext">Though he was only thirty-three, America had
heard of him as a surgeon, and that is no slight
triumph in a land of many clever surgeons.  What
was dearer to him was the fact that in Medical
Science the "other fellows" knew of him--the big,
silent men beating their way by inches along the
hampered road of Progress--they recognised him
as one of themselves, a worker not for money nor
personal glory, but for humanity.</p>
<p class="pnext">Skill with the knife, being at its best no more
than a fine collaboration of hand and eye, never
yet sufficed a brilliant intellect, and it had not
sufficed Westenra.  His keen mind, not content
to follow on the lines laid down by other men,
craved for higher work in the discovery and
formulation of new principles of treatment in diseases
that defied the surgeon's knife; and it was in the
laboratory that he had won the triumphs he most
valued.  In spite of a heavy hospital and private
practice, he had found time to do some unique
experimental work in connection with the intestinal
canals, while on the subject of locomotor ataxia
he was already considered something more than
an expert.  But the diseases that lured him most
were those in which surgery failed to give the
relief hoped for, and one such he had specially
starred out for laborious investigation.  He knew
when he determined to devote himself to the
subject of the metabolic disorders underlying diabetes,
that years, perhaps a lifetime, of experiment and
ardent unpaid labour lay before him, but he faced
the prospect boldly, for he doubted not that in the
end he would have as great a gift to bestow upon
the world as even Lister, Metchnikoff, or Pasteur.</p>
<p class="pnext">Not much time in such a life of planned hours,
tasks, and duties to think of women.  And, indeed,
except as cases, he had not definitely thought of
them.  But, like all Celts, he had an inner world
of his own in which he walked sometimes, and
did not walk alone.  A mystical subtle knowledge
was his that somewhere in the universe a woman
was waiting for him--the woman with the pale
Oriental face and the grey gown.  And in his
heart he listened for the delicate approach of
footsteps from out the distance and the Future.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line">"Dear, were your footsteps fast or slow?</div>
<div class="line">One look or none did you bestow</div>
<div class="line">When carelessly, as strangers go,</div>
<div class="inner line-block">
<div class="line">You passed my door?"</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="pfirst">He understood the listener in those lines with
the imagination of one who in a city office or
hospital can hear the sounds of birds and insects,
and feel the wind of the moors on his face and see
the gloom of trees.  The dark waves of the
Atlantic had often seemed to him symbolic of
the Irish nature; dark and sad to the outward
view, but when the wind ruffles the surface
showing light and beauty beneath, secret inner palaces
of green crystal.</p>
<p class="pnext">But to-night his loneliness oppressed him as
never before.  It seemed to him he had waited too
long in a land of dreams and shadows.  He left
the sea and stars at last and went to his cabin.</p>
<p class="pnext">At dinner for the first time since the boat sailed
the seat next his own was occupied, though he
scarcely noticed the fact until he found himself
sitting beside a woman.  A young woman he saw
at once by her hands, all that he could see of her
very well, for however curious a man may be it is
difficult for him to take the bearings of a person
with whom he is seated cheek by jowl.  Westenra
was not at all curious, but even when he was the
dreamiest of Irishmen he was also a trained
observer, and to take notes on the people with whom he
came in contact whilst apparently absorbed in his
own affairs was as natural to him as breathing.  He
could almost make a diagnosis from a hand, and
the next deductions he drew from the slim ones of
his neighbour were not all so pleasing as the first.
For one thing he saw that she was an intensely
nervous woman, even though she spent so much
time out of doors, ungloved, that her hands were
burnt to a pale brown tint.  They were more like
a boy's hands than a woman's, except that they
were so nervously febrile and covered with rings.
The rings called for attention.  They were odd
and barbaric, and of far greater beauty than value,
for most of the stones were semi-precious, and
their charm lay in their quaint settings and brilliant
colouring.  There were miniatures surrounded by
amethysts, marquise rings of blue and green enamel
with devices in rose-diamonds, olivines and
sardonyx set with seed-pearls and an Angelica
Kauffman under a crystal.  On the thumb of her right
hand she wore a very fine black scarab heavily
set in platinum, and on the index finger of the
same hand a silver ring of rough workmanship
made in the shape of a V with a stone like an uncut
ruby imbedded in the point of the letter.  Nothing
so commonplace as a wedding ring was to be
observed amongst this eccentric collection.  The
forefingers of her left hand were faintly tinted
with the amber of nicotine.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Smokes too much," thought Westenra, and
might have supposed her left-handed but for a
worn, hard little mark on her right middle finger.
"Writes, and smokes while she 's writing," he
deducted, and thought none the better of her for that.
When she ordered a brandy-and-soda to drink with
the sardine she was dissecting he liked her still less.</p>
<p class="pnext">"She won't be in the game long at that rate,"
he estimated grimly.  "With <em class="italics">her</em> nerves I 'll
give her another two years at most."  He hated
to see women drink.  Experience had taught him
that few of them can do it long without going to
pieces morally.  And here was one who would
certainly go to pieces physically as well.  On this
conclusion he felt no further inclination for
observations.  But that did not prevent him from
hearing what she had to say.  She had struck up a
little conversation with the man on the other side
of her, speaking in a nervous contralto voice that,
without being throaty, contained a curious husky
tremor giving almost the suggestion that she wore
a veil over it.  Without the assistance of his
previous deductions Westenra would have known
it at once for the voice of a temperamental woman,
as well as that of a woman of the world; and was
the more astonished therefore, at her free <em class="italics">bon
camarade</em> manner with her neighbour, a French
Jew with a mean expression on a clever face--a
financier or dealer in jewels Westenra judged, and
a none too scrupulous one at that.  They talked
about the ice on the table and where it had come
from.  The Jew was not sure whether it was
Norwegian ice or manufactured on the boat, but was
full of information about the New York supply
and the great frozen lakes from which it was cut
in enormous blocks.</p>
<p class="pnext">"I must go and see them!" said the woman
eagerly, "and the far solitary tracts of ice and
snow in Alaska!  I <em class="italics">must</em> see them."</p>
<p class="pnext">She talked like a woman who had fever in her veins.</p>
<p class="pnext">"You like cold places?" asked the Jew curiously.</p>
<p class="pnext">"No!  No!  I hate cold, but I like wide, solitary,
empty lands and countries I have never been to.
I would love to wake up every morning of my life
in afresh place."</p>
<p class="pnext">Westenra admired reserve in a woman, and was
thoroughly astounded at such a lack of it.  There
was worse to come.  Her friendly candour revived
the French heart of the Jew to a corresponding
friendliness which by some persons might have
been considered impertinent, but did not seem in
the least to offend this one.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Excuse me, mad'moiselle, but I never saw such
original bracelets.  Might one ask what they are
made of?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Ivory," she answered pleasantly.  "I got
them in Central Africa.  They were cut green
from an elephant's trunk."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Elephant's trunk!" murmured the Jew, and
even Westenra had to smile.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Oh! tusk I mean, of course.  And the red
things imbedded in them are garnets from De
Beers's Mine in Kimberley.  I think they are
ever so much nicer than diamonds, don't you?"</p>
<p class="pnext">The Jew tried to look as if he did, and succeeded
fairly well.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Here is another in my silver ring.  A Zulu
made this ring for me in Natal, out of a
half-crown.  I gave him the garnet to put in, and
another half-crown for making it."</p>
<p class="pnext">If the Jew were outraged at the idea of any
lady wearing such cheap jewellery, he concealed
his feelings under a silky smile.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Then you know Africa, mad'moiselle?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"I know every country except America," she
said.  "But I think Africa is the only one in the
world that I could stay in always without getting
bored."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Ah!  Is it Johannesburg you like?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Oh, no--Rhodesia--Zululand--the Drakenberg
Mountains--the open veldt."</p>
<p class="pnext">The Jew stared.</p>
<p class="pnext">"For a lady you have been to very unusual
places," he commented, and if the words were
ambiguous the tone was not lacking in courtesy.</p>
<p class="pnext">"I love to travel," she said, "and it is
my business to see things and places.  I am a
journalist."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Indeed!" said the Jew, and stared again, for
she was quite unlike any journalist he had ever met
or heard of.  But she gave him no time for any
further astonished questions.</p>
<p class="pnext">"I must go," she said abruptly.  "This saloon
is too hot."  Smiling pleasantly at him she drank
up her brandy-and-soda and departed, the Jew
rising up also and bowing her out of her seat
in a way that Westenra considered officious, yet
could not but notice that with a courteous
smile on him the fellow was not so mean-looking
after all.  The Irishman gave a glance
after the figure of his late neighbour.  She was
tall and slight with a firm light walk, but as
she went down the aisle made by two long
dining-tables the ship rolled gently, and she
put out her pale brown hands here and there
touching a chair back.</p>
<p class="pnext">Proceeding with his dinner, which had as yet
only reached the second course, Westenra reflected
that it would be difficult for any woman, even with
a bet to win, to give herself and her affairs away
more thoroughly in a short space of time than his
late neighbour had done.</p>
<p class="pnext">"With both hands she did it--and her tongue,"
he mused cynically.  "In no longer a time than it
took to dine off a brandy-and-soda and the outline
of a sardine!"</p>
<p class="pnext">After sitting next to her for a matter of twenty
minutes he knew all there was to be known of
her tastes, her profession, her temperament, her
habits.  She had travelled, she wrote for the
newspapers,--sensational stuff probably, her head
was too small for a thinker's head,--she was entirely
modern, cursed with nerves, restlessness, and
dissatisfaction; she was unreserved, unreposeful,
uncontrolled, undisciplined; she drank, she smoked.
He really could not think of anything about her,
except her charming voice, which of course she could
not help, that was not in violent opposition to his
every idea of what a woman should be, and the
fact filled him with resentment born of a kind of
chivalrous discontent that any woman should be
so far from the ideal standard.  He entirely
withdrew his earlier supposition that she was a
woman of the world, in spite of the evidence of
travel and experience.</p>
<p class="pnext">"A woman of her type could never contend with
any kind of social life.  The way she let that Jew
draw her was childish."</p>
<p class="pnext">At that moment something happened that
thrilled through his nerves and veins like an
electric shock, and left him mentally stunned.</p>
<p class="pnext">The woman of whom he had been thinking was
coming back down the long saloon, her delicate
hands put out to the chair backs in the same little
frond-like movement as before.  For the first
time he saw her face clear and full; and he did
not have to look twice to recognise it.  Though
it had always eluded his memory in waking hours
he knew it now that he saw it as well as his own.
<em class="italics">It was the face of the woman he had dreamed of for
years</em>.  He knew her hair, her eyes, her mouth, the
grey gown she had on, the deep collar of fine lace
ivoried by age that turned away from the base of
a long throat that had fine ivory tints of its own.
He even knew the necklace of luminous
grey-green beads that swung to her waist.  The
wistfulness of the Irishry that he remembered so well
lurked elusively about her eyes and mouth, and
the touch of Orientalism was there too, though it
was hard to tell of what it came, for if her hair
was black and her skin Arab-pale, her sad eyes
were not dark but of a curious smoky blue.  As
she came nearer she looked straight at him, her
glance for a moment seeming to rest in his, and
he saw that like the eyes of many clever people
hers possessed a slight defect; they were different
in shape and expression; one seemed to be long
and sleepy and almost cynical looking, the other,
rounder, held an eager inquiring glance that
suggested great vitality and ardour.  This was
Westenra's fleeting impression, there was no time
for more, and he was almost too aghast for clear
thought; but a glance of his eye went a good deal
further than most people's, and in this instance
his vision was sharpened by the strange
circumstances of his dream.</p>
<p class="pnext">It appeared that she had come back to her seat
to fetch a little silk bag of the kind that women
were then using to carry about their handkerchiefs
and purses.  She spoke to no one, only leaned
over the back of her seat, took her bag and went
away, and it was all over in two or three seconds.
But in those few seconds a man's life had been
changed.  The world would never look the same
again to Garrett Westenra.  Obliged to add to all
his scornful opinions of the woman who had sat
next to him outraging his ideals, the astounding
knowledge that she was the woman of his dreams,
the living presentment of the vision that had for
years so mystically haunted his life, he was shaken
to the Celtic roots of him.  He felt as a man feels
who has lost something precious and irreplaceable.
Something was broken and gone from his life.
The beautiful spun-glass globe of illusion he had
carried so secretly was shattered in the dust.  In
that moment of bitter realisation he was not a
surgeon and scientist from New York, but a
primitive man from Ireland keening in silence for
a nameless sorrow.  The desert grief of his race
welled up from the depths of him, and the taste of
his waters was as the taste of the waters of Marah.</p>
<div class="center transition">
<p class="pfirst">――――</p>
</div>
<p class="pfirst">There were few people on deck.  The wind was
chill, and the stars burned with the brilliant
sapphire pallor of electric light.  There was a special
spot where Westenra always stood to smoke,
because it gave him a leaning place against the rail
where he could command the length of the deck,
and yet get an uninterrupted view of the grey
waves with their pale sea palaces.  Close beside
him in a canvas-sheltered corner stood his deck
chair.  He lit a cigar, but he might have been
smoking seaweed for all the aroma there was in it
for him.  Abstractedly he stared at the
phosphorescent waves, but his attention was on the
door of the companion-way, and presently, as he
had felt sure she would, the woman in grey came
through it with her swaying movements and her
hands put out a little.  She had wrapped herself
in a long silky cloak that gleamed in the starlight,
and as she strayed up and down the deck like a
grey ghost, the wind took hold of it and flicked it
about her making it crack like a silken sail.  It
took fronds of her hair too and made them into
lashes that beat her face and blew above her head.
She laughed a little to herself as she was blown
this way and that, and for the first time that night
she pleased Westenra, for he loved the wind, and
it seemed to him that she loved it too.  He stood
very still listening to the tap-tapping of her heels,
thinking of--</p>
<blockquote>
<div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line">"Dear, were your footsteps fast or slow...?"</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="pfirst">and of how long he had listened in office and
hospital for the sound of a woman's feet coming
towards him.  He remembered the bare broken
feet of the woman in his dream, though he had
always dimly recognised that the mud and blood
were symbolical of the rough paths she had walked.
These that tapped the deck near him were daintily
shod in grey <em class="italics">suède</em>, but from her own telling they
had strayed in far places of the earth and echoed
in lonely spots before they came his way, as they
were coming now.  Would they halt when they
reached him?  Resentful, antagonistic, and
disillusioned as he was, something in his fatalistic
Irish nature responded, some bird sang in a pale
green palace when she stood still beside him, and
spoke:</p>
<p class="pnext">"Do you think I might sit in this nice sheltered
corner?"  She looked at the chair and then at
him, with a boyish <em class="italics">bon camarade</em> smile that
banished all the sadness and shadows from her face.</p>
<p class="pnext">"I 'm sure you might--please do."</p>
<p class="pnext">He moved forward swiftly and arranged the chair
for her.  She sat down, and as he did not move
away began to talk to him in the same friendly
easy way as she had used to the Jew, and he found
himself, like the Jew, answering her if not eagerly
at least with interest.  However they touched only
on generalities.  She did not tell him nearly so
much as she had told the Jew and he found in
that too something to resent.  Possibly she missed
the French receptivity, or with the quicksilver
sensitiveness of some women divined antagonism,
for something like a little note of appeal came
presently into her voice: it was as though she
were trying to soften his heart towards her.  In
answer to some observation of his with regard to
travelling she said rather wearily:</p>
<p class="pnext">"Yes; one discovers these things when one has
knocked about the world long enough."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Knocking about the world" was not a process
that usually enhanced a woman's charm, in his
eyes at least; but he soon became aware that all
charm was far from being knocked out of this one.
Charm came out of her like a perfume, and stole
towards him.  But he steeled his heart against
it and against her, so that a glint of the steel
presently came into his eyes and seemed to ring in
his voice.  Certainly something in him chilled
the little tendrils of good fellowship and friendliness
that she seemed inclined to extend.  At last
shivering slightly and drawing her cloak about her,
she stirred in her chair, preparing to go.  But he
stayed her with an odd and unexpected question.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Do you always wear grey?"</p>
<p class="pnext">She laughed and turned to look at him curiously.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Now I wonder what makes you ask such a
strange question?"</p>
<p class="pnext">Enraged with himself, resentful of her, he was
far from any intention of telling her his real reason.</p>
<p class="pnext">"It hardly seems to be your colour."  He spoke
abruptly and realised immediately that he was
being rude.  But she was not offended at the wry
compliment.  Whatever her faults might be she
seemed at least to be untroubled by that one
paramount in most women--vanity.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Are you an artist?"  She leaned forward and
looked at him with the free curiosity of a child.</p>
<p class="pnext">"No."</p>
<p class="pnext">She waited an instant as though expecting to
hear him supplement his curt answer, but her
frank impulsive methods waked no answering
echoes, and she sank back with a little sigh.  He
felt ashamed of his churlishness.  Never before
had he been so unresponsive to friendly advances;
but apart from his instinct not to allow this woman
to probe him, it had always been a principle with
him never to disclose his profession to
fellow-travellers.  When he came abroad it was to rest,
and he had found that the best way of doing so
was to keep his identity dark from the world at
large.  However, his taciturnity if it chilled her
could not make her change her manners and
customs.</p>
<p class="pnext">"You are quite right," she said at last, speaking
as though there had been no awkward interlude.
"Grey is not my colour.  I always wear blues and
reds and oranges--anything bright and Oriental:
not only because I am pale but because I love
vivid colours.  If when I am unhappy I put on
something crimson it seems to warm and cheer my
heart like a fire.  Don't you think the robin is
happier for his red breast?"</p>
<p class="pnext">Westenra said nothing.  She had switched his
mind off oddly to the things he loved in his
boyhood--birds hopping in the garden, the robin's note--a
rabbit flashing past through the dewy grass.</p>
<p class="pnext">"If ever you are in deep despair and can see a
field of poppies all glad and aflare under the blaze
of the sun----"</p>
<p class="pnext">She appeared to have forgotten him and to be
talking to herself.  He too was away amongst the
dews and tender sunshine of Ireland.  He knew
no blazing fields of poppies, but remembered them
gay amongst the corn in the long fields.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Or sunlight on fields of glowing corn," she
said softly, "green land growing right down to the
blue sea--trees turning to red and gold in the
autumn--a bank of purple irises--gilded aloes
spiking against the sky."</p>
<p class="pnext">There was a strange little dreaming silence.</p>
<p class="pnext">"I never had a grey gown in my life until now,"
she said suddenly.</p>
<p class="pnext">Westenra looked pale in the starlight; there
seemed almost to be in his skin a tinge of the colour
she mentioned.  Her words switched him back too
suddenly from Ireland to a remembrance of her
unwarranted likeness to his dream woman.  She
had even gone so far as to talk in the way that
woman might have done!  To pretend that she
cared for the things that woman would care for!</p>
<p class="pnext">"What made you get one now?"  He knew not
what fatalistic curiosity prompted the question.</p>
<p class="pnext">"I got several," she said quietly.  Her manner
was still friendly, but there had come into it a
certain graveness that he thought might be
intended by way of rebuke, until he heard the end
of her sentence.  "You will never see me in any
other colour on this ship.  I am wearing grey as a
sort of mourning for my husband."</p>
<p class="pnext">"I beg your pardon," he said slowly, startled,
astounded, and puzzled.  A widow!  Oh!  She
<em class="italics">could n't</em> be the woman he had dreamed--the whole
thing was ridiculous!  Grey for mourning?  That
was new to him.  But perhaps the fellow had been
dead a long time, and she was just going out of
mourning?  As if in answer to his thoughts she
made another of her curious statements.</p>
<p class="pnext">"We had been such bitter enemies that I felt
it would be hypocritical to go into real mourning
for him.  But he died a fine death, and in honour
of that I thought I might at least absent me awhile
from the felicity of bright colour."</p>
<p class="pnext">She rose to say good-night, and as she stood there
looking at him for a moment with her elusive Irish
smile and her Oriental air, he saw that, tell
himself what he might, widow or no widow, hers was
indeed the face he knew so well.  The long
shadows thrown by the lights behind her fell about her
feet recalling the vulture shadows of his dream.
Her cloak flickered round her like a silken sail,
and the beads about her neck swung and softly
clicked as dice might click in the hands of Fate.</p>

<p class="pfirst">There are few men who in thinking ahead,
however vaguely, to the time when they
will share life with a woman do not expect to find
their ultimate kingdom in the heart of some girl
with a face like the morning and a nature fresh
and unspoiled as an opening rose.  With the
freshness faded from his own heart and the "songs
of the morning" long forgotten, this modest
instinct to allot to himself the beautiful and the
ideal remains deeply rooted in the best and worst
of men.  Of Irishmen it should be said in
extenuation that they are usually greater idealists than
the generality of men, and possess the instinct of
worship more strongly.  They do not always
make fortunes nor gain fame; but they make
shrines.  And deep in the nature of every one of
them sits fast the belief that the finest woman in
the world is surely for him because he has the
finest shrine ready for her.  If she does not fit,
it is not the fault of the shrine, which is composed
of the very best materials--that stuff of which
dreams are made.</p>
<p class="pnext">Garrett Westenra had all the bigoted simplicity
of the man who has never loved and been deceived.
There is nothing like a wrecked shrine or two for
getting rid of unworkable notions about the uses
of women as idols; but no woman had ever
deceived him, so he had kept all his faith and
bigotry and generous beliefs to bestow upon the one
woman--a golden apple with a bitter core perhaps,
for it is not always fair to the woman to have too
much in this line to bestow.  Being a citizen of
the world he did not of course suppose that fine
qualities and a beautiful nature are only to be
found in the opening-rose type of woman, but
certainly he had unconsciously or otherwise
assigned to the woman of his dreams all the
traditional virtues and graces of character and bearing.
He had come of fine simple people: one of the old
Irish families who through poverty and misfortune
had lived for generations with the simplicity and
austerity of peasants, but whose men had never
lost their breeding and bearing, and whose women
were strong and fearless without breaking the laws
of their religion.</p>
<p class="pnext">One of his ancestresses had eloped with a
Westenra, and pursued by her disapproving
brothers, the pair had swum a river abreast;
later, when having fought one brother after the
other the bridegroom, wounded in the legs, was
unable to walk, his wife carried him on her back
for miles to a place of safety--not that he was
small and weak (no Westenra was ever that),
but that she was big and strong and fine; her
wedding ring, a thin thread of gold, had come down
through generations to Garrett Westenra and
fitted his third finger easily.  His great-grandmother,
daughter too of an old but impoverished
family, had not disdained to rebuild with her own
hands the house in which she afterwards lived and
died.  These were the single-hearted, simple,
faithful women,</p>
<blockquote>
<div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line">"Strong and quiet like the hills,"</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="pfirst">from whom Westenra had sprung.  Tradition dies
hard when it is rooted in such firm ground.  Small
wonder that dismay blotted out delight when he
recognised at last the romantic face of the woman
he had waited for, only to find it allied to the
strange, rootless, roving, almost vagrant
personality of Valentine Valdana.</p>
<p class="pnext">Even if every one on the ship except himself had
not appeared to know that she was Mrs. Valdana
<em class="italics">the</em> journalist, he could not long have remained in
ignorance of her name for "Val Valdana" in
writing so illegible as to invoke curiosity was
written on everything she possessed, and she left
her possessions everywhere.  She was the most
careless woman in the world.  She lost and mislaid
books, cushions, papers, and rugs; her shoes were
frequently undone, and her hair almost always on
the point of coming down.  Yet she never looked
untidy because her feet were pretty and her hair
was of the feathery kind; and in the matter of her
lost possessions she preserved entire calmness,
for some one was always obliging enough to
find them for her and bring them back.  Once she
left on deck a book full of audacious sketches and
notes about the passengers, and the wind ruffling
the leaves of it dispersed scraps of paper in every
direction.  One of these displayed a pair of
love-birds sitting beak to beak on a branch, but the
birds possessed the life-like features of two cranky
old maid passengers who were continually
squabbling in public; beneath was the scribbled legend:
"<em class="italics">If we comfort not each other, Who shall comfort
us in the dark days to come?</em>" ... Another
entitled "<em class="italics">La planche</em>" was the portrait of an
enormously fat lady passenger grown extraordinarily
slim and pretty.  A little pink hard-shelled
woman with a habit of making up to people only
to say something extremely unpleasant to them
was cartooned as a crab reaching out and nipping
everything within reach.  A moony-looking
individual with a wry neck, peering eyes, and a loud
brown check suit had lent his individuality to the
sketch of a tortoise pottering curiously about the
deck.  A newly-married couple who were always
sipping egg-nog together had been pilloried as the
Siamese twins joined by a large egg.</p>
<p class="pnext">Yet when the cartoonist came on deck the
victims of her pencil were all ready to smile at her,
and return her property without resentment.  It
was so patent somehow that malice was the one
thing absent from the mental make-up of Mrs. Valdana.</p>
<p class="pnext">Another day soon after their first meeting,
Westenra found her in her deck chair with one slim
foot twisted round to inspect what is sometimes
known as a "potato" in the heel of her stocking.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Isn't it amazing how holes in one's stockings
arrive?" she remarked to him pleasantly.  "I
would n't mind only I 've got such tender heels."</p>
<p class="pnext">Impossible for a thoughtful man who has known
poverty and carried memories of his mother's
fingers worn with darning to imagine such a woman
as a wife and mother.  Plainly the shrine Westenra
had built for the woman of his dreams could never
be occupied by this one.  No shrine could keep
for long so restless a heart, nor fireside and cradle
detain such wandering feet!  As the days went
by the likeness in fact that he had seen in her to
his vision became blurred and faded.  It was
not difficult at last to persuade himself that his
recognition of her had been a fantasy of his brain.
Once the thought dismissed of any mystical bond
between them, he could not help liking the
incompetent, careless creature and finding pleasure in
her society.  She was a good companion: not gay
herself so much as the cause of gaiety in others.
She rarely said witty things, but it was surprising
how witty others became in her company.  Her
art was of the kind that seems to underlie rather
than break through the surface of conversation,
leaving the best points for others to make.  But
sometimes when things were at their dullest she
would suddenly send up a little sparkling rocket
that lit the mental horizon and thrilled the
surroundings with colour.</p>
<p class="pnext">Westenra, whose native wit and eloquence
needed little sharpening, was at his best with her,
and he became his pleasant and extremely engaging
self while enjoying to the full that charm in her
that from the first he had not denied.  Her ardent
feeling for the ideal and the original was a spur
to his intellect, and not only re-awoke his natural
gaiety, but set stirring all his altruistic dreams.
For there was greatness smouldering in Westenra,
that needed only the right woman's hand to fan
it into flame.</p>
<p class="pnext">No one observing Mrs. Valdana listening, almost
thirsting for all he had to say, would have guessed
that as far as actual experience of life went, hers
had been far wider and greater than his, for the
usual results of experience--callous indifference or
a calm philosophic outlook--were amazingly absent
from her.  She was vividly interested in life, and
the more she saw of it, the less <em class="italics">blasée</em> she became;
and because ideas interested her even more than
experience she was deeply interested in Westenra.</p>
<p class="pnext">If the latter had ever lived in England he would
infallibly have recognised the name of Valentine
Valdana as being that of one of the foremost
women journalists in the world.  Even had he
been in the habit of reading those American
Sunday journals whose overseas cables in a surprisingly
small space manage to mention the doings of
everyone of importance, he would have realised that so
far from being the "small-headed, yellow
journalist" he supposed, she occupied a unique and
enviable position in the newspaper world.  But he
had never concerned himself with the doings of
European journalists.  America is a big country,
with big enough personalities and interests of its
own to absorb such attention as a man wrapped
up in his work and the great scientific facts of life
has to give to public affairs.  Thus it came to pass
that he did not know there was one thing
Mrs. Valdana, with her odd eccentric gowns and
ornaments, a hole in the heel of her stocking, and her
black hair endlessly coming down, was not careless
about, and that one thing was her work--and that
because of her work she was famous.</p>
<p class="pnext">Certainly she was not the person to tell him,
being as reticent about the astonishing things she
had done as she was childishly frank about her
picturesque tastes and fancies.  She would show
her ivory bracelets cut green from the tusks of an
elephant in Central Africa, or howl in the
moonlight like a jackal, or dance like a Somali warrior
(as she did at the concert got up for the sailors'
benefit), or describe the orchids that hang like
glowing lamps from the trees in the deep steaming
forests of the Congo; but she would say nothing of
her articles on sleeping sickness and Congo atrocities,
or how she had nearly lost a foot on a terrible
march in Somaliland, but turned out an amazing
Odyssey on the manners and customs of a little
known people.  She always forgot to mention that
it was she who had shot the elephant from whose
tusks the bracelets came, and that her knowledge
of jackal music was acquired in a lion-infested
part of Bechuanaland, where she had got lost from
her party and spent a sinister night up a tree.</p>
<p class="pnext">Next to Africa she loved India best in the world,
and could discourse alluringly on the subject of
<em class="italics">phul-karries</em>, and silk embroideries from Delhi,
of sunsets seen across the plains when the
buffaloes and the goats are being herded home in a
mist of golden dust; of paddy-birds standing in
shallow grey pools, and the grace of the swathed
women coming from the wells.  Chanting through
her nose a thin monotonous wail, while with three
fingers and her thumb she made a measured
thrumming tattoo on the table, she could conjure up
the very heart-throb of the Indian Bazaar until
the never-ending rhythmic torment of the East
dragged at the heart of those who listened.  She
could tell too every kind of amusing story and
scandal about Anglo-Indian society; but she would
never mention that she had been sent out in '97
to get for her paper the truth about the Tochi
rising--and had got it; that she was at Simla when the
English were waiting breathlessly for news from
their men at the front, knowing that any serious
reverse in the Tirah might possibly mean an
attempt at a general rising and massacre in the
plains and hill stations of the Punjab, and that she
was one of those women who had gone out as
usual to balls, and laughed and jested with sickening
fear in their hearts, under the keen eyes of the
native servants--and afterwards had sat in her
room hour after hour sorting and classifying her
facts, embodying them in the strong vivid articles
that a few weeks later made England "sit up" for
awhile and realise that all was not peace and fair
contentment in the Indian Empire.</p>
<p class="pnext">There were lots of other interesting things
Mrs. Valdana never told.  She had been in Russia on
a mission for Mr. Stead, and in Turkey to probe
out the affair of a secret concession for turquoise
searching granted by the Sultan to an English
Member of Parliament.  She had interviewed De
Witte, the Red Sultan, and Paul Kruger, and
stayed at Groot Schuur as Cecil Rhodes's guest.
But all these things were part of her work, and of
her work (except to other journalists) she never
spoke.  It spoke for itself.</p>
<p class="pnext">Though she had done special work for many of
the big London papers she was a free lance and
under bonds to no journal.  No inducement that
could be held out to her was strong enough to lure
her from her ways, which were the ways of a
literary vagabond who came and went at no man's
bidding, but achieved her best work by wandering
only where she listed, and writing only what her
heart urged.  This might have been fatal to
financial success, but that it was allied to an
instinct that amounted to genius for the big vivid
things that take hold of the public imagination.
Every good journalist has a nose for news;
Valentine Valdana had the added gift of an "eye for
colour"; she saw it across continents, recognised
it overseas, followed it as her star; and what she
wrote concerning it editors were pleased to
scramble for.  If one disapproved of her "stuff" another
was only too glad to embrace it.  She revised and
blue-pencilled for no man.  Her creed was Byron's
when he wrote to Murray: "Cut me up in the
<em class="italics">Quarterly</em>, rend me in the Reviews, do unto me as
did the Levite unto his concubine, but do not
ask me to revise, for I cannot and I will not."  She
would not either, and she did not have to.
Enough that her stuff was signed with her
well-known nom-de-plume "Wanderfoot" for it to
sell like hot cakes.  In fact, in her own line
Valentine Valdana was famous; and Garrett Westenra
did not know it.</p>
<p class="pnext">Nor would he have been greatly impressed if he
had known.  He was entirely opposed to that
kind of fame for a woman.</p>
<p class="pnext">All Irishmen, whatever their rank or situation,
are at bottom profound lovers of nature, virtue,
and simplicity; and from this great quality of the
heart springs the singular charm that makes them
the most attractive people in the world; but it
has a defect in its almost peasant standardising of
women.  Lack of money in Ireland has created in
the Irish an eternal oversense of the value of
riches; but though there has never been any lack
of women in Ireland they are not undervalued on
this account (in fact, as has been shown, they are
given shrines to occupy).  Still there is a secret
and peculiar hatred in the Irishman's nature for
any change in the status of women, moral or
intellectual, since the time of Mother Eve or the
beloved Madonna.  The wife-and-mother is the
ideal, and very rightly so, but she is a meek and
submissive and gentle wife-and-mother, and she
sits eternally by the fireside with a child on her
knee.  Yes, though in his heart he will crown her
with a golden crown and burn incense before her,
that is where an Irishman always sees the ideal
woman--by the fireside, with a child on her knee.
No true Irishman will ever be a suffragist.</p>
<p class="pnext">Considering these things it was surely unwise
of Garrett Westenra, very much an Irishman, to
linger day after day by the deck chair of a
vagabond woman, who, from all accounts and
appearances, had never possessed a fireside of her own,
nor was ever likely to appreciate one.  Yet linger
he did, and day by day her charm wrought upon
him and wound itself round him and penetrated
him until it seemed to become part of him.  By
no effort of hers was the thing done.  She grew
strangely silent as the voyage drew towards an
end, sitting in her chair with still eyes and hands,
like a woman in a dream drifting down a dream
river.  Once more she began to resemble the
woman Westenra knew so well--the mystery
woman with whom he had walked for many years
in his secret garden.  And when he came on deck
and did not find her in her place, the deck and the
ship and the world seemed to become suddenly
empty--with an appalling emptiness.</p>
<p class="pnext">But always when alone in his cabin he made the
same observation to himself.</p>
<p class="pnext">"This thing has got to stop.  It is rank
foolishness.  What do I know of her?  God knows what
her life has been.  She is not the woman I have
dreamed of.  She is not within a hundred miles
of the kind of woman I could spend my life
with....  A reckless, careless vagabond!
Good-hearted, yes, full of fine impulses ... full of
charm!  But when the glamour has gone
... what then?"</p>
<p class="pnext">He had that gift and curse of his race of seeing
too far--the worthlessness of the prize at the end
of the race, the rotten core inside the rosy apple.
Perhaps why Irishmen achieve so little, is that
nothing which can be got seems to them worth
while getting!</p>
<p class="pnext">So he said to himself firmly:</p>
<p class="pnext">"This thing has got to stop."</p>
<p class="pnext">He said it and meant it right up to the last
night of the voyage--a night when they stayed
late in their deck chairs under a glorious moon that
transformed the sea into a golden harvest of
promise.  Many other couples sat along the deck
laughing and jesting, announcing their intention
to stay up until the Statue of Liberty hove in
sight, but well aware that the purser would be
prowling along the deck at about half-past ten
with hinting scowls for all loiterers.  Long before
the purser came, however, the keen air had driven
most people below, and there was no one left
except Westenra and Mrs. Valdana, and a far
couple in the shadow of the bridge.</p>
<p class="pnext">A silence had fallen upon Westenra and his
companion, one of those silences that have lips to speak
and hands to caress.  A little wind blew past them
carrying a snatch of her hair across his lips.  He
had never before felt a woman's hair on his lips!
Her pale hand nervous and lonely lay outside the
rug in which she was wrapped.</p>
<p class="pnext">"That hand looks cold lying there," he said,
and taking it drew it under a fold of his own rug,
and held it fast.  It lay in his without response like
a little stone hand, but through his palm he could
feel her pulse beating wild and uncertain, and that
stirred him strangely, yet awoke the doctor in him
too.  He remembered the brandy-and-soda she had
drunk the first evening, and every evening since.
He remembered too his own cynical thought, and
repeated it now, though his voice held little cynicism.</p>
<p class="pnext">"I 'll give you two years longer to live if you
keep on at this rate."</p>
<p class="pnext">"What rate?" she asked in surprise.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Drinking, smoking, taking drugs.  What drug
is it you take?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"You seem to know all my vices," she said
laughing a little tremulously.  She was leaning
back in her chair looking very pale.  "I have to
take veronal sometimes to make me sleep."</p>
<p class="pnext">"You would sleep naturally if you gave up
smoking and drinking, and lived a quiet natural
life."</p>
<p class="pnext">"But then I could n't write."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Well, you must give up writing."</p>
<p class="pnext">"But then I could n't live," she said laughing.
"You don't seem to know that I write for my
living--it is my work."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Your work is a curse to you if it makes you
do these things."</p>
<p class="pnext">"It is all I have," was her strange answer.</p>
<p class="pnext">He turned in his chair and looked at her.  In
her face was none of the bitter humiliation of the
woman whose weaknesses are suddenly exposed
and condemned.  She was smiling a little, a smile
with a twist to it, like the smile of a child who is
determined not to weep.  And her smoke-coloured
eyes, bright and sad with tears, and exile, and
lost joys, and all the sorrow of the Irishry, were
the eyes of the woman who had been given
him in a dream.  While he looked at her she
closed them and sat very still.  At last he knew
that there was no question of fleeing from Fate.
He leaned forward and laid his lips on her sad
smiling mouth, and found there the answer to
many a question.</p>
<p class="pnext">Yet when he spoke it was to ask another.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Now will you leave writing?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Yes, Garrett," she said simply.  "I will leave
everything for you; I think it was written so in
the beginning of things."</p>

<p class="pfirst">With Westenra's kiss still warm on her lips
Valentine Valdana knelt in her cabin,
elbows plunged in the low plush-covered lounge,
eyes closed, lips slightly parted, her upturned face
resting in the palms of her hands as still and rapt
as the face of a visionnaire, and indeed it was in
visionary scenes that her mind wandered: scenes
of the past peopled with the absent and the dead.
Sometimes her lips moved and she spoke a name--her
mother's, her father's, a child's, an old woman's,
that of a man who lay by her mother's side in
the Durban cemetery--one whom the world had
known as a brilliant but drunken journalist, but
whom she remembered only as a great heart and
loved friend.  For she had a great capacity for
loving, this woman; she did not know how to merely
like people; when she cared at all she loved and
gave her best.  She loved all the people with whom
she was dreaming now, and she loved them still
with a love that reached over seas and past the
grave; in her radiant new-found happiness her
thoughts flew to them wishing that they too might
be glad with her.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Dear Dick ... I am so happy," she said,
visualising the drunken journalist, not as others
had seen him, a short red-faced man with bright,
haggard eyes and a sardonic mouth, but as the
big-hearted man of letters who had generously taught
a young uneducated girl all he knew of his craft.</p>
<p class="pnext">In memory she sat again in the stuffy Johannesburg
newspaper office with the maps on the wall,
tables hidden under a jumble of papers, chairs
covered with tobacco ash, books, whiskey bottles,
and heard the voice of Dick Rowan pounding
"style" into her while the mine batteries drummed
outside, and the windows reddened and rattled
under the assault of a blinding Rand dust storm.
Her thoughts passed to another man who had
worked with them, and who lay now in the little
cemetery behind the Primrose Deep; to another
sniped in the streets of Mafeking who had written
to her by the last post that came from the
beleaguered town; to another dead in the shadow of
the Himalayas of whom she could not think
without remembering the paddy-birds in the rice fields
near Benares; another sleeping on the shores of
Lake Chad.</p>
<p class="pnext">For like all women thrown early on the world to
make a living she had found her best friends among
men, and the very adventurousness of her own
life had brought her into contact with adventurous
men of the kind whose lives are full and vivid and
of sudden ending.  Of the men who "did things,
and died in far places" she had known a-many,
and been proud of their friendship, and with all
the ardour of an ardent nature she had loved them
every one in her boyish, good-comrade way.
And they had all passed on or passed away!
But she wanted them to be with her in this hour.
She called on every one she had loved, or been
loved by, to rejoice with her now.  She even laid
in thought a flower of amnesty upon the memory
of Horace Valdana, but with him she did not linger,
for in the memory of her husband was neither
beauty nor joy, and in that hour she wished only
to remember things that gave no hurt.</p>
<p class="pnext">For she too believed that the fate which through
the open and winding passages of life had been
seeking after her had found her at last; that of all
the men she had been loved by, and she had been
greatly loved, here at last was the one whom her
heart and mind had awaited--a real man with
something of the lion in the hold of his head and in
the quality of his sure glance and careless smile,
who "did before the sun and moon whatsoever his
heart appointed," and was no man's man but his
own.  She saw that Westenra was big in mind and
spirit, self-trusting, self-reliant; and every woman's
heart responds to those iron strings.  Every
woman hopes to find in the man she loves
something big and vast and eternal in which she can
become absorbed, and lose herself.  For every
woman has the secret fear that by herself she is
nothing, can be nothing, and has no eternal life
except in and through love.</p>
<p class="pnext">She had loved Westenra from the first with all
the wise and foolish reasons a woman will find
for putting her hands under the feet of the beloved,
for his boyish laugh, and the way his hair grew,
his witty tongue, the simplicity of his heart, and
the subtlety of his mind; for his big head and
broad shoulders, for the grace and strength of him,
for his curious personal shyness and his wide,
impersonal outlook; for the twist his race had
given to his speech, and for his handsome face
which was not handsome at all, but the face of a
thinker who has been up against the hardest
problem in the world--ignorance.</p>
<p class="pnext">These were the things she knew that she loved
him for, but she was aware without going too
deeply into the matter that the other and more
important ones that she had long sought were there
too.  Dimly she knew that the maternal woman
in her, the subconscious mother who seeks for
greatness in the father of her children, was
satisfied with Westenra and that promise of eternity
in his eyes.  And because of this she was willing
to renounce all that her life had been and might be,
to change all in herself that he did not like, to
become of him and for him.  She had always
known that a time like this would come, when she
would throw all she had worked for and earned
to the winds, for the sake of a man who wanted
her not because she was a famous journalist, but
because she was a woman and the woman for him.
But the condition was that he must be the man
for her too.  She had waited long for that
condition to be fulfilled, passing over many a fine
heart because her own refused or was unable to
give the countersign to his challenge.</p>
<p class="pnext">And at last the hour had come, as it always does
come to those who know how to wait.  From the
moment she first spoke to Westenra and looked him
in the eyes she had felt that mystic stirring of flesh
and spirit that comes only once and is so unmistakable.
She had realised then that to have this man
always in her life would be to touch the highest
peaks of the far blue mountains of romance.  And
the moment she realised it she felt hopeless.  For
never in her life had she got anything that she
ardently desired.  Happiness had evaded her and
joy had passed her by.  To know now at last that
Westenra loved her, that the greatest desire in her
life was to be fulfilled, seemed too wonderful to be
true.  The gratitude that filled her was curious
in so clever a woman, and one who had had many
men at her feet; but a childlike humility
concerning herself was one of her sweetest qualities.</p>
<p class="pnext">In the presence of those she loved she never
remembered that she was famous, gifted, travelled,
and honoured, and withal young and attractive.
It always amazed her that any one should find her
clever and charming.  And that Westenra, who
did not even know or care what she had done as a
journalist, should find her desirable just because
she was Valentine Valdana and a woman was the
most amazing and beautiful thing in the world.
It opened life out upon a boundless horizon, and
flooded the future with a love great enough to cast
out all devils of the past.</p>
<p class="pnext">She knelt long by her bed, half-praying,
half-pondering on sad things gone by and glad things to
come.  Out of it all came a resolve that the next
day she would tell Westenra the whole story of
her life of strange adventure and misery.</p>
<p class="pnext">There were many things that to speak of would
cause her wretchedness, but it was not the shameful
wretchedness of those who, resisting no temptation,
have taken all they wished from life, leaving
nothing for the future but regrets.  Her sorrows
were sweet and untainted.  There were many
things of which perhaps people of hedged-in lives
might think she should be ashamed, but which
seemed to her to be natural and simple and
nothing.  She had gone up and down the world and
seen so much in the way of suffering, known so
many complications of love and life, that nothing
astonished or even shocked her any more.  She
had been through the mill and "seen life," as the
phrase goes; and whether or not that is a good
thing for a woman, and whether or not the spiritual
vision gets a little dimmed in the process, and the
senses a little dulled, is a matter of opinion.  The
fact remains that at the age of twenty-six Valentine
Valdana still retained such freshness of heart
that she could kneel for an hour or two at her
bedside in a state of contemplative prayer,
unembittered by the past and full of hope for the future.</p>
<p class="pnext">A witty but unhappy writer whose life proved
the truth of his epigram wrote that "good
resolutions are cheques which we draw on a bank where
we have no account."  But at twenty-six
Valentine Valdana could still, with serene confidence
in her power to honour them, draw cheques upon
this bank of the soul: so perhaps after all life
had not done so ill by her as might have been
supposed.</p>
<p class="pnext">Her life-story was a curiously unusual one.
The touch of Orientalism in her eyes and hair was
a legacy from her grandmother, a beautiful
Egyptian girl born in a harem and stolen therefrom by
an adventurer who was deep in the counsels and
intrigues of its lord and owner, her father.  The
two fled from Egypt to Zanzibar, where, under the
protection of the Sultan, they married and lived,
the Irishman making himself as useful and necessary
to the negro Sultan as he had to the Egyptian
chief.  The beautiful little harem-born wife from
association with her husband and the few
Europeans in the place learned to speak English, and
her only child, a girl who resembled one of the
wonderful tropical flowers she lived among, was
brought up in European fashion by an Irish nurse
sent for from Ireland.  In time the Egyptian
mother died, and the Irishman, fallen on evil days
through Court intrigues and an affliction of the
eyes, was obliged to flee from Zanzibar and make
for the only country where he and his child could
keep warm and live cheaply--Italy.  There, the
girl, Iolita, learned to perfect a gift of dancing she
had always delighted in, and when later her father
became totally blind and penniless, it was she who
bravely maintained the affair of living for both
of them by dancing at the theatres and the opera
until she danced her way into fame.</p>
<p class="pnext">Child of a passionate love-marriage it was only
natural that Iolita too should follow her heart.
In London, at the very zenith of her success and
just when Fate was unrolling before her a vista
of luxurious years, she proved the heritage of her
blood by eloping to Africa with the youngest
son of an English peer, a being as romantic and
irresponsible as herself.</p>
<p class="pnext">Gay Haviland had tried his hand at most things,
from Shakespearean acting in London to
horse-breaking in Mexico, before he found his true
<em class="italics">métier</em> as a transport-rider on the South African
veldt.  The home to which he took his
eager-hearted bride was an ox-waggon drawn by a span
of twenty magnificent red bullocks, which earned
their living and his by carrying loads of wool and
grain from the Free State and the Transvaal to the
Cape.  It was on a St. Valentine's Day from the
tent of that waggon as it lay under the shadow of
the Catberg Range, that little Val first saw the
light, and the same tent was the only home she
knew, except for occasional sojourns in Dutch
towns, for the first nine years of her life.  From
a child's point of view it was an ideal existence, full
of beauty and variety as far at least as scenery was
concerned, adventures with big game, long days
of camping on the banks of wild rivers or in
the shade of purple mountains, and an absolute
absence of the tasks and training common to
children brought up in the ordinary way.  It is
true that at camping times the dancer amused
herself by teaching little Val to read and write
in Italian, while the transport-rider successfully
imparted to the child, together with his poetical
if vagabond views of life, a very real love and
knowledge of Literature.  For if ever scholar
turned gipsy it was Gay Haviland, and though the
book he loved best was Nature, and his library
the Open Road, his waggon-boxes were always well
stocked with works of classical and modern writers.</p>
<p class="pnext">Val imbibed his tastes and vagabond creeds as
a flower imbibes dew, but for the rest she was as
free and idle as a little wild buck prancing across
the veldt in the wake of its mother, and as
unthinkingly happy.</p>
<p class="pnext">With Haviland's tragic death from snake-bite,
however, the veldt life came to a sudden end and
passed for ever into the realms of memory, seeming
to Val in the hard years that followed to have
been a wonderful dream, yet remaining always
the most poignant and cherished part of her
existence.</p>
<p class="pnext">Poverty showed its jagged teeth to the beautiful
dancer, frightening her back to Europe, where she
essayed to gain her living once more with flying
seductive feet.  But her dancing was not what it
had been.  Ten years of idle and ideal love on the
veldt had spoiled her art, or perhaps the wife and
mother had absorbed it.  At any rate she was
unable to step back into the vacancy created when
as Iolita Fitzpatrick she had left the stage for love
of Gay Haviland.  Other stars had arisen, and
the public had forgotten her.  Engagements were
difficult to find, and when found were at best of
the second-rate order.  Neither help nor
sympathy was forthcoming from the proud English
family who, having always detested poor Gay
Haviland's <em class="italics">mésalliance</em>, absolutely repudiated any
connection with the dancer or her child.</p>
<p class="pnext">Years of arduous struggle followed during which
the two trailed from one great continental city to
another, often miserably poor and in desperate
straits, sometimes perilously near starvation, but
thanks to the generous Freemasonry of Art, and
grace to their own happy charm in good and evil
times, never quite without friends, or some last
resource.  It may truly be said that Val's
education was received in the school of Life, for she
never attended any other; but the love of books
inculcated by her father stayed with her, and
because book lovers will always, whatever their
straits, get books, Val was able to educate herself as
many another has done, and done well, by reading.
Then, too, with the open mind of the untaught
she received and retained all the beauty and
colour and picturesque event of their wandering
Bohemian life, finding even in their grimmest
adventure food for thought and amusement.</p>
<p class="pnext">When she was fourteen, and Iolita still astonishingly
beautiful in spite of poverty and defeat, an
engagement took them to the Argentine Republic,
but ending up disastrously left them stranded and
almost penniless at Buenos Aires.  Things were
at their darkest when good luck dawned once more
in the shape of Dick Rowan, an old friend of
Haviland's, and who together with the latter had
adored the dancer in the days when she was a star.
Rowan was a brilliant but eccentric man of letters,
afflicted by the wanderlust.  His adventurous
temperament, irked by life in cities, had driven
him forth as a journalist to far lands, where he had
become as famous for his war and political
correspondence as for his dissipated ways and generous
heart.  He was an expert on the political situation
of various Colonies and smaller Powers, and
whenever little wars were on the carpet there also was
Rowan.  In times when wars were not, he occupied
himself with the internal wranglings of Colonial
governments.  Wherever he could force his way
in he made himself felt.  It was not for nothing
he was known as "Gadfly" Rowan.  At the period
of his re-meeting with Iolita he was interesting
himself in the Transvaal with the affairs of Paul
Kruger and the Uitlander, up to his eyes in political
intrigue, and editing a Johannesburg journal
with Imperialistic leanings.  His presence in the
Argentine on some business of his own was the
veriest accident, but a happy one for Iolita, for,
faithful to his early passion, he was overjoyed to
find her again, and asked nothing better than to
take her burdens upon his shoulders and be a
father to Gay Haviland's daughter.  Iolita, on
her part, had always felt a great affection for the
journalist.  It seemed a pleasant end of weariness
to consign her fate into his eager if improvident
hands.  So they were married, and the family of
three sailed for Africa, where for the next two
years they spent a busy, happy, and erratic
existence together, surrounded by journalists,
politicians, and all the quick wits of the Rand.  From
the first Val showed a keen liking which Rowan was
swift to foster for newspaper writing.  He took
her as his secretary, and taught her on broad lines
all that is most useful for a journalist to know.
None knew better than Dick Rowan how to direct
a natural talent for journalism, and in Val he
recognised splendid material, a born vocabulary,
a keen sense of observation, love of phrase, and
a knowledge of books and places.  Above all,
she was full of ardour for the work.  Nothing
lacked but training to apply her genius, and this
Rowan, erratic and irresponsible in all things but
his profession, was the best person in the world to
give her.</p>
<p class="pnext">From being his amanuensis she soon became his
assistant.  A great devotion sprang up between
the stepfather and daughter.  Later, when Iolita,
visiting Durban, died and was buried in that
beautiful seaside town, the two drew closer in their
loneliness and sorrow.  Val was eighteen then,
and Rowan ageing rapidly, for he always lived
every moment of his life, and always he "poured
spirits down to keep his spirits up."  Because of
this his energy and brain were both beginning to
fail; and here the value of the hand and head he
had trained was proved.  Work was offered to
him that he would never have been able to accept
but for Val.  It was she who urged him on, worked
with him and for him, repaying her own and her
mother's debt by unwearying devotion.  A
commission to proceed to Somaliland, a splendid
opportunity for glory, came from a great London
Daily, but Rowan's initiative would never have
been equal to it without Val.  She not only made
him go, but went with him, and when he fell ill
there, and the newspaper correspondence devolved
upon her, as well as the nursing of her stepfather,
so well did she accomplish both, that Rowan got
well and she reaped recognition.  For Rowan, rigid
as all good writers about the identity of work,
insisted on the authorship of the letters being known.
Shyly she appended "Wanderfoot," the nom-de-plume
she had chosen, to her first unaided work.
It looked like a special effort on the part of the
god of irony that before the end of the expedition
she nearly lost her feet through inflammation
caused by overwalking.</p>
<p class="pnext">After Somaliland, commissions came to her
singly, but from a sense of loyalty she would do
nothing except in connection with Rowan; so
they worked and travelled together going to
different parts of Africa from the Cape to Egypt,
until one day landing in Durban to make a
flying visit to the Transvaal, Rowan paid with
dramatic suddenness the penalty for burning up
his brain and liver for years with whiskey and
the best wines.</p>
<p class="pnext">Val found herself alone in the world, though not
helpless, for her own and Rowan's efforts had
given her a weapon with which to fight for and
hold her place among the journalists of the day.
But she was only twenty, and as hopelessly
impractical as the conditions of her life and Rowan's
happy-go-lucky methods could make her.  He
was one of those who knew no use for money
except to make it fly faster than it came,
living gaily ahead of his income to the tune of
the old saw:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line">"Happy-go-lucky,</div>
<div class="line">Penny loaf for twopence,</div>
<div class="line">Got no shoes go without."</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="pfirst">Val's journalistic intelligence had been developed
at the expense of her practicability for everyday
purposes.  She could already make money, but
she had no sense of the value of it.  A number of
things she had gathered hi the course of her
vivid life could not be tabulated, for they were
intangible, nor valued, for they were priceless;
but of common or garden prudence and
horse-sense she possessed no single jot or iota.</p>
<p class="pnext">What she did possess and wear for all the world
to recognise was a disquietingly attractive
appearance, and the fascination that hangs about the
personality of one who is able to <em class="italics">do</em> something,
and that something well.  To this was now added
the wistful charm that sorrow stamps upon her
elect.  All those whom Val had loved had left
her one by one.  She began to believe herself
doomed to loneliness--that she had but to love to
suffer the bitterness of loss.  The cerebral
hemorrhage with which Rowan had been smitten had left
him a few merciful clear hours before death, and
during that time he had impressed upon her the
wisdom of going straight to England and making
the most of his literary connections there.  But,
in spite of this injunction, she had lingered on from
day to day in the expensive Durban hotel where
he died.  She could not drag herself away from the
two graves that lay in the heart of the town,
sheltered by palms and feathery trees, with the naked
feet of Zulus pattering past up and down the
Berea hill, and ricksha bells echoing between the
marble crosses and headstones of the dead.  She
shrank and faltered from turning her face towards
a new life empty of love.</p>
<p class="pnext">That was a propitious moment for Horace
Valdana to step upon the scene.</p>
<p class="pnext">Handsome, with the marks of race on him, and
no outward sign of his dark heart, he was of the
exact type to attract a romantic girl's interest.
Val, lonely, impulsive, but lacking in judgment,
fell in love with the man she believed him to be,
and without hesitation placed her fate in his hands.
There was no one to warn her (and if there had
been it is doubtful whether she would have believed
that he was a thorough-paced blackguard, whose
family, sure by bitter experience that he would
some day openly disgrace an old and honoured
name, and deciding that it were better for him to
do it in the Colonies than at their door, had financed
him to go abroad and stay there.  Africa is full
of such--"remittance boys," ne'er-do-wells, men
who have left their country for their country's
good.  Most of them, when they arrive at least,
have good manners, often the stamp of a public
school on them.  Nearly all possess the charm and
guile that are special attributes of the professional
black sheep.</p>
<p class="pnext">Valdana was a perfect example of this
professional black sheep--whom novelists and
playwrights have encouraged into existence--the man
who talks rather sadly about his family never
having seen any good in him, but who, by
"carving out a career" for himself means to show them
some day that he is "not such a waster after all!"  Any
woman of the world would have seen through
him in a very short time; but poor Val was no
woman of the world, only a gifted, romantic girl,
with all the worldly stupidity and shortsightedness
of her kind.  It should, perhaps, be counted to
Valdana's credit that he married her instead of
playing some trick upon the innocence of which
her varied life had not yet robbed her.  But
trickery would have meant plotting, and Horace
Valdana was too lazy to plot.  Besides, he was
well informed enough to know that Val had value
as a wife who could make money.  So Val got a
real marriage certificate, and became a real wife,
and in a very short time knew the meaning of real
misery.  Until then the hard luck and misfortunes
which Fate had dealt her had at least been shared
by loyal hearts and faced with courage and gaiety;
but now it was her lot to discover how bitter
sordid poverty can be when shared with a mean
and vicious nature that exacts all and gives less
than nothing in the great give-and-take game of
marriage.  Valdana darkened life for her and
blotted out the stars.  He walked on her illusions
and hopes, and threw down her idols.  She
sometimes felt as if he had wiped his boots on her soul.
Wretchedness and a child were the outcome of the
ill-starred marriage.  Still soft and pliable with
youth, she might have forgiven the first for the
sake of the last, but her husband, utterly bored by
her innocence and uselessness, very soon decamped
leaving her to shift for herself and the child as
best she might.</p>
<p class="pnext">It was quite true as has been told that she was
utterly useless in the ordinary way.  She had
received absolutely no training in the practical
things of life, except of the most rough-and-ready
kind.  She could light a camp-fire with any one,
and shoot something to cook on it afterwards, but
she was far from knowing as much about domestic
life as even an ordinary Boer girl, and quite unfit
to be a poor man's wife in Africa or anywhere else.
The one thing she could do well was to write up
big picturesque events for the newspapers; but
such things have to be sought first and written of
afterwards, and now she had a baby to bind her
hands and stay her wandering feet.</p>
<p class="pnext">There came another dreary era of struggle.
Freed of the cankering taint of Valdana's presence,
the young mother plucked up enough courage and
money to get back to England, where she judged
her best chance lay of making a living.  But the
connections and introductions she had counted
on using there were in the end of very little use to
her, for the reason that she could not now continue
her special line of work.  There were still things
happening in out-of-the-way parts of the world, but
Val could not leave her young child to go and
write about them, and after one or two offers had
been made to her and declined she got no others.
As for the conditions of English life and journalism
she knew nothing of them.  Besides, a place
in the London journalistic world has to be worked
and waited for on the spot; outsiders are not
encouraged, and have a bad time while trying to
push in.  When at last she realised that all she
could hope for was an ignominious place in the
queue among the hack writers, the girl proudly
buried the name made memorable by collaboration
with Dick Rowan, and disguised under that of
Valdana, took what she could get to keep the wolf
from the door.  For herself, travelling on a dark
road where all the stars had gone out, she would
have cared little if at this time starvation and an
end had come; but the tiger maternity was awake
in her and cried out for the preservation of little
Carmen.</p>
<p class="pnext">From the first the child had doubled her anxieties
by being delicate, and in England its health did
not improve.  Many a time in the weary London
months the mother tripped up the journalist just
as the path looked a little clearer or was
smoothening out to a surer footing.  Many a promising
opportunity of regular work had to be passed by
because of some baby illness that needed all the
careful nursing Val could give.  But youth and
courage were still on her side; and in her heart the
secret conviction which thrills every mother--that
her child is an important link in the chain of
generations, that a woman's career and ambitions
are as nothing compared to the keeping alight of
the little flame which may some day become a
beacon to humanity.  What mother's heart has
not trembled to this illusion?  How many babies
would ever reach maturity if this secret religion
did not hold sway in women's hearts, urging them
to sacrifice, pain, drudgery, and self-abnegation?</p>
<p class="pnext">And after all the struggle was in vain.  The
baby died, and Val, more lonely and alone than
ever before, wished that she too might die, for
it seemed that life was never to hold anything for
her but work.  And oh! the weariness of work that
has not love for its compelling force!  Oh! the
longitude and lassitude of life without loved ones
in it!</p>
<p class="pnext">Fortunately, something occurred at this time
which not only took her away from the scene of her
loss, but occupied her every thought for a
considerable period.  The Jameson Raid in the
Transvaal shook England to the heart with various
emotions, and called for a great deal of information
that could only be acquired at the scene of
operations.  The Editor of the Imperialistic Daily,
which had employed Dick Rowan, found himself
keenly regretting the "Gadfly" and his deep
knowledge of the internal workings of the
Transvaal Government, then remembered "Wanderfoot"
and her application of a year or so back.  A
search was instituted, and within a week Val was
sailing for Africa full of instructions that gave her
little time in which to remember the emptiness of
her heart and the dull ache of loss, or anything but
the affair she was sent upon--to get speech of both
President Kruger and the members of the Reform
Committee who lay in Pretoria Gaol.</p>
<p class="pnext">The series of brilliant articles sent by her from
Johannesburg dealing with the reign of terror at
that time exercised by Transvaal Boers over the
betrayed and despairing English population; the
history, written in terse, mordant, heart-wringing
phrases of that famous trial, when four of the
Reform Committee were sentenced to death, and
the rest to "two years' rotting" in a foul prison;
these constituted the first steps in the ladder by
which Valentine mounted alone and unaided, rung
by rung, to journalistic fame.  After that no more
need to seek work; it sought her.  There were
commissions to India, Turkey, Russia, and Mexico,
and with each new adventure were fresh laurels,
for her work improved as the work of a writer can
only improve when she gives it her heart and soul
and serves no other god.</p>
<p class="pnext">Thus, after struggling and climbing practically
from the age of fourteen up the craggy hillside
of Fame, she had in her twenty-sixth year reached
a point nearer the top than do most women.  True,
it was not universal fame, but the fact remains,
that to any one who read with understanding the
British newspapers, her name stood for work both
brilliant and sound, a fine temperament and a
great future.</p>
<p class="pnext">When success first began to come her way, Valdana
cropped up again, smiling and ready to step
back into her life.  But sorrow had taught Val a few
things and opened her eyes to the real worthlessness
of her husband's character.  She recognised
coldly and clearly at last just what he was--a lazy,
unscrupulous scoundrel.  Even more unforgivable
was the fact that he had not cared a rap whether his
child lived or died of starvation: that she could never
forget.  Therefore, though she gave him money,
even unto the half of her income, she refused to
return to him or allow him to come back into her
life.  He became so troublesome, however, that
she was on the point of seeking legal protection
from him, when the Boer war broke out, and in the
urgent interests of her newspaper she was obliged
to put private affairs aside, and start immediately
for Africa.  After a year there of unceasing work
and travel, she succumbed to a bad illness, resulting
from overtaxed energy, and it was while she lay
ill in Cape Town that Valdana made a fresh move
in the game.</p>
<p class="pnext">It must be mentioned that before his people,
realising his lack of all moral sense, and fearful of
future dishonour, had decided to despatch him to
Africa, he was intended for the army, and had been
educated and trained to that end.  His parents'
decision was a bitter blow to him, for the
picturesque side of army life appealed to him greatly,
and he chose to believe and to frequently air the
modest opinion that in him a very gallant soldier
had been lost to England.  Now, when in England's
dark hour she called for men to volunteer
their services in Africa, came his chance, and with
a promptness he only exhibited in his own interests,
he applied for a commission in one of the corps
raised in London.  His application was at first
refused, because there were plenty of good men of
tried experience to fill such posts; but a clever use
of his wife's name and work got him into the
limelight.  He did not even disdain to make use of her
illness, and the fact that she had been brought
almost to death's door in the service of the public.
So finally he got his commission and sailed for the
front in a glow of publicity.</p>
<p class="pnext">Then, for a blackleg and a ne'er-do-well whom
no one wanted, he did an extraordinary and
unheard of thing--he died!  And not content to
merely die, he did the thing well; nobly and
heroically he did it, in company with a dozen or so
men of his troop.  They were isolated in a
farmhouse, surrounded by a large number of Boers, and
refusing to surrender were cut up to a last man,
and the house set afire over their wounded bodies.
Some grudging curmudgeon had invented a tale to
the effect that one of the band had slunk out, and,
deserting his wounded comrades, escaped.  But
no one had ever been able to prove the lie, and
even the Boers themselves gave evidence of the
splendid courage of the little band, and especially
of their leader, the last to die with a laugh upon his
lips.  All England rang with Horace Valdana's
name.  Val, already bright in the public eye, had
the added lustre of her gallant husband's glory
shed upon her.  Shoals of sympathetic letters and
telegrams reached her in Cape Town, and, on the
occasion of her return to England, having been
rigidly forbidden by the doctors to continue her
war correspondence, she was met by crowds and
cheered to the echo.  But both sympathy and
cheers were wasted upon her.  She received them
coldly and silently, without tears and without a
widow's desolate mien.  When it was presently
observed that she also dispensed with the
habiliments of wo, and went about in London as if
nothing had happened, she was severely criticised,
and people began to dislike her.  Moreover, a
mangled history of the unhappy marriage got out;
it was soon known that there had been great faults
on one side or the other.  Tales with a tang to
them of Valentine's friendships abroad with
well-known men were told in the clubs, and as the men
concerned had mostly died or disappeared, there
was no one on the spot interested or well informed
enough to dispute the truth of them.  What was
worse, an entirely cruel and untrue version of her
relation to Dick Rowan during their travels and
exploits together was bruited about, though always
so carefully that the victim of the scandal only
caught dim echoes of it, and was never able to
seize and nail the lie to the mast.  In the end,
needless to say, the woman paid.  "Gallant
Horace Valdana" got more than the benefit of
the doubt as far as the unhappy marriage was
concerned, and his widow was sent to social
Coventry.</p>
<p class="pnext">Little she cared.  The world meant nothing to
her.  She had wrestled too bitterly with life to
set any undue value on the approval of society,
even had she not possessed a congenital carelessness
amounting to indifference to the opinions of
any except those she loved.  As long as those few
knew the truth--as they could not help doing,
knowing her--and their love loyally remained
unaffected, she gave little heed to calumny; it
was enough for her to realise that she was free at
last of Valdana.  She tried not to rejoice too much
at that, but rather to weed out from her heart the
last blade of bitterness and scorn of the dead man,
so that the rest of life might be lived unpoisoned
by hateful memories.</p>
<p class="pnext">At this period of vague mental unrest and
retrospection, the offer to her from a famous newspaper
to visit America on its behalf came pleasantly
<em class="italics">à propos</em>.  Sick of London and the arid memories
it contained for her, she was thankful to shake its
dust from her feet for a time at least and turn her
face to a new and unknown horizon.</p>
<p class="pnext">And now, during the process of getting into her
soul once more the dew of forgiveness and
loving-kindness, Westenra had come marching into her
life, and her heart cried out as the heart of Iole
cried out when they asked her how she knew that
Hercules was a god:</p>
<p class="pnext">"Because I was content when my eyes fell upon him."</p>

</div>
<p class="pfirst">And while Valentine stayed on her knees
thanking God for the happiness that had
come to her, Garrett Westenra was pacing the
darkened decks with misgiving in his heart.  The
misgiving was not regret.  When you are of those
who stand by your given word you do not waste
time in anything so idle as regret.  Besides, what
had come to pass between Valentine Valdana and
himself seemed a thing so predestined and
inevitable, so unsought by either of them, that it would
have been as vain to regret it afterwards as to
have fought against it at the time.</p>
<p class="pnext">Some one once said of the Irish that they appear
to be impulsive, but are really the most deliberate
people in the world.  They know long beforehand
what they are going to do, though they perform
it at a given moment with all the appearance of
impulse.  This was true in a way of what had
happened between Westenra and Valentine.  He
had known from the first what was going to happen
even when he said in his cabin, "this has got to
stop."  He had really put up a hard struggle with
Fate, for while he was certain that Val was the
woman originally intended for him, it seemed that
something had gone wrong with the plan.  Somehow
she had got lost on her way to him, and life
had changed her until she was no longer the woman
he wanted and had dreamed of, though she still
resembled her.  He felt as if there was a hole in his
nature, in his life, that only she could fill, that must
go unfilled for ever unless he let her in, yet he
wished to keep her out!  So he had fought against
the thing, but as a man fights who knows he must
be overwhelmed in the end by superior force.  It
was that force, something outside himself and far
bigger and stronger, that had been at work when
he turned so deliberately and kissed Valentine's
lips.  The moment had possessed an extraordinary
enchantment.  Never had he known such a magic,
glowing sweetness as surged through his being
when she surrendered her lips to his.  And a little
later she had strangely said:</p>
<p class="pnext">"I think this was written from the beginning
of things!"</p>
<p class="pnext">It was indeed so written.  None knew better
than he who for years had been haunted by her
face.  He told her so, or the something that was
outside himself and greater than he told her so.</p>
<p class="pnext">"I have known you all my life, Valentine.  For
years I have seen your face in my dreams.  I
recognised it the moment I saw you.  I always
knew you were somewhere in the world, coming
towards me, for me."</p>
<p class="pnext">And yet he could not feel sure that he loved her!
Every word they said bound them closer.  He was
as much hers as she was his.  Never again could
they be nothing to one another.  And yet
... and yet ... was this love?  No answer among
the stars nor in the phosphorescent water flashing
past.  And if his heart knew the answer it would
not speak, but lay strangely still and sad in his
breast.  With a mental jerk he forced his mind to
another matter, and one that urgently called for
consideration.  In those few magic moments of
sweetness drawn from a woman's lips, the whole
current of his life for the next few years had been
changed.  The plans he had built up were thrown
down and broken.  The big thing starred out for
his own special contribution to medical science had
been pushed far back into the future where he
could only reach it after years--instead of going
right straight to it now, as he had meant when he
started on this voyage!</p>
<p class="pnext">Vaguely he had known it must be so if he let
Valentine into that empty place which no woman
had ever occupied.  The knowledge that he must
sacrifice that ideal of his, must leave following the
star to which he had hitched his car for something
else--something of which he did not know the
value, or if it had any value at all--was one of the
reasons that had urged and compelled him in his
cabin to fight against that force which was stronger
than himself.</p>
<p class="pnext">Well!  It was over now.  The die was cast.
All that remained to do was to rearrange certain
circumstances in his life in accordance with this
new plan.  The circumstances resolved themselves
into the bitter ungarnished fact that he was not
rich enough to marry and still carry on his fight
for science.  As a bachelor living with a simplicity
that amounted to austerity, his income, the savings
of unceasing labour for ten years, sufficed.  It was
not enormous, but it served to relieve him from the
wear and tear of general practice, and allowed him
many hours of leisure in his laboratory.  The
only hospital appointment he had retained, on
giving up his practice, was one where facilities were
afforded for studying the disease in which he was
specially interested.  Thus the main part of his
life was spent between the hospital and his
laboratory.  He scarcely practised medicine at all in
the ordinary way, except as a consultant on the
diseases in which he had specialised.  But now
he must return to the old routine of visits and
office hours.  Marriage demanded an income, so
the laboratory must be pushed into the background,
and a scheme for money-making take the boards!</p>
<p class="pnext">However, he had realised from the first that
marriage entailed this sacrifice, and with the
sweetness of Val's lips, he accepted the condition.  It
was too late now to look back to his waiting
laboratory, and unflinchingly he shut down on the
thought.  That phase of life was finished with--for
some years.  He had no right to ask a woman to
accept life in a bachelor's quarters on a bachelor's
income just because his laboratory held for him a
dream that might some day crystallise into Fame.
He told himself with gloomy stoicism that women
want nearer and dearer things than fame glimmering
at the end of a long vista of years.  He must
return to the arena of money-making, beat up his
old practice, get back into the harness he had
thrown off little more than a year ago.  It would
be difficult at first, but he was not afraid of
difficulties.  He flung back his head a little at the
thought.  Then his mind fell suddenly busy on a
plan that had been suggested to him just before
leaving New York by a clever young physician
named Godfrey, a fellow-student at Columbia.
Godfrey had a scheme for a nursing home, and
wanted Westenra to stand in with him on it.  The
idea was to take a large house near Central Park,
equip and furnish it as a private hospital with
plenty of bedrooms and a good operating-room.
There Westenra could perform all his operations
and hand over his patients afterwards to
Godfrey's care, while Godfrey could in like manner
hand over his surgical cases to Westenra.  Thus
the two would work into each other's hands in
a perfectly legitimate manner, and double their
incomes.  It is a favourite method of
money-making with New York medical men, but it had
no appeal for Westenra, and he had smilingly
told Godfrey that he was not the man for the
business.</p>
<p class="pnext">"But you are," urged the physician.  "You
are 'It.'  There is no other fellow in New York
to whom I would hand over my cases so fearlessly.
And then, there are very few who could return me
such a <em class="italics">quid pro quo</em> as you can."</p>
<p class="pnext">Which was perfectly true.  Westenra's practice
when he renounced it had been very large.  Few
surgeons had one like it.  Certainly it lay among the
working classes.  But it is the people of the
working classes in New York who pay their doctors' bills
more conscientiously than any other.  Godfrey's
practice, on the other hand, lay among the leisured
class and was of a more precarious nature, bringing
in large sums at one time and at another very little.
Combining the two practices would undoubtedly
regularise and increase the incomes of both men.
Many medical men far less successful and
well-known than Godfrey and Westenra were making
fortunes by this method.  However, Westenra,
with ambitions very different to Godfrey's taking
shape in his mind, had not thought twice about
rejecting the offer.  Now he wondered if it were
still open, and determined to go and see Godfrey
instantly on his return.</p>
<p class="pnext">It was after midnight when he finished his
deck-pacing and pulled up at the smoke-room with the
idea of getting a light for a final smoke before
turning in.  Being the last night of the voyage
many of the men passengers had stayed up later
than usual making merry.  However, all had
retired now except a party of four lingering over
drinks at a table.  One still shuffled a pack of
cards though the game was plainly at an end;
two others smoked idly; all were listening to the
gossip of the fourth, a certain Reeder--a
narrow-nosed, cynical fellow who had something to do
with the publishing world, and whose specialty
was retailing scandal about the private lives of
writers.  He was pleasantly occupied with his
favourite topic when Westenra quietly entered.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Clever woman, yes.  I should say she had
cracked or broken most of the commandments
except the eleventh in the course of her career....
I 'll swear no woman could live with Dick
Rowan without chipping the seventh--even if
she did call herself his stepdaughter.  Certainly
Valdana was a rotten scamp ... but no doubt
he had his little cross to bear while she was gadding
the earth with half a dozen other fellows....
Journalists are gay dogs! ... I remember
hearing of her----"</p>
<p class="pnext">He glanced up to find Westenra staring at him
with ice-cold eyes, and for a moment he faltered,
changing colour.  The other men's facial expressions
varied from apprehension to a certain degree
of jeering amusement.  They were all aware of
Westenra's constant companionship with the most
attractive woman on the boat.  For days the
matter had been a topic for speculation among the
first-class passengers.  However, Reeder was not
without a dash of cur-dog pluck, and with an
effort regained his composure and essayed to
continue his story, though now he was wise enough
to employ a certain amount of discretion.</p>
<p class="pnext">"I remember hearing of the lady of whom we
were speaking----"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Be good enough to leave that lady out of your
vile smoke-room scandals," said Westenra quietly--so
quietly that a pistol shot could not have been
more effective.</p>
<p class="pnext">Reeder moistened his lips.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Indeed!  And why?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Because otherwise I shall be obliged to knock
your lies back down your throat."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Lies?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Yes, lies!"  Westenra came close and bulked
over him, ready to eat him up if he said another
word.  He would have liked to beat the fellow's
brains out on the spot.  But Reeder like a wise
man climbed down hastily, ate up his scandal,
apologised with profusion, and slunk away.  In a
few moments Westenra had the smoking-room to
himself.  But he could not breathe in it--even
when he returned to the deck and his pacing, with
all the winds of the Atlantic at his disposal, there
did not seem sufficient air for him to breathe with
ease.  His tongue was dry and the taste of life
was bitter in his mouth.</p>
<p class="pnext">Now he knew why his heart lay still in his breast
and gave no answer when he had asked if this were
love!  The empty place in his nature, in his life,
in his heart, was a shrine--and Valentine Valdana
could never fill a shrine.  She was charming and
delightful, she called for pity and for chivalry,
she might be a bright comrade on a weary way,
there was a magic sweetness in her lips ... but
she would never fill a man's shrine!</p>
<div class="center transition">
<p class="pfirst">――――</p>
</div>
<p class="pfirst">A few hours later the big ship slid peacefully into
home waters, the pale gold sunlight of a September
morning flickering delicately on the waves,
piercing the lavender-tinted land mists and gilding the
torch in Liberty's upraised hand.</p>
<p class="pnext">Westenra, somewhat haggard-eyed, paced the
deck once more, but he was not alone.  Mrs. Valdana,
fresh as the morning itself, looking rather
like a wild violet in a swathed purple cloak and
velvet hat of the same colour crushed down on her
hair, took the deck with long gliding steps beside
him.</p>
<p class="pnext">With the exception of an old lady sitting huddled
in rugs by the companion-way, and a stony-eyed
New Yorker gazing fixedly over the taffrail at the
approaching shores of "God's own country," they
were alone.  Every one else seemed to be hustling
luggage or busy downstairs with the port officers.</p>
<p class="pnext">In her hand Mrs. Valdana swung her rope of
luminous beads.  They were queer pale green
things almost as large as the ordinary "white
alley" marble; too delicate and light to be of
stone, there was yet something so natural about
them it was impossible to suppose them a
composition.  They reminded Westenra a little of his
pale sea-palaces, seeming to be lighted from within
by some pearly luminous light, soft yet strong.
Each bead had on it a perfect little picture painted
with the minute and exquisite art of the Chinese.
On one a flight of tiny blue birds, on another a
delicate spray of mimosa, a branch of peach
blossom, a snow-peaked mountain, a scarlet-legged
flamingo, a still blue lake, a volcano, a tree bursting
into bud, a line of sapphire hills.  One could spend
a day examining them, for there were a hundred
and fifty, each more wonderful than the others.
Westenra, who had never seen her without them
round her neck, asked her now why she was not
wearing them.</p>
<p class="pnext">"I hope never to wear them again," she said.
"They are my comfort beads, and only to be worn
in time of unhappiness.  An old exiled Russian
gave them to my mother in Spain saying, 'If
ever you or your children are in great misery these
beads will help you.'  And it was quite true.
She always wore them when she was in deep trouble
and they gave her comfort.  Mr. Bernstein, that
nice French Jew who sits the other side of me at
table asked me the other day to let him know if
I ever want to sell them.  But I shall never want
to--they are so beautiful, aren't they?"  She
drew them rippling through her fingers.  She
said "aren't" like the people of his country, an
inheritance from her Irish grandfather perhaps,
together with the superstition that assigns to
inanimate things the power to do good or ill!</p>
<p class="pnext">"I should n't be too certain of not wearing them
again," said Westenra, smiling a little grimly,
for vaguely he knew that the woman who married
him might very well at times have need for
comfort.</p>
<p class="pnext">"I know," she said gravely.  "It is only when
one loves that one realises how one may fall upon
misery at any moment.  The world seems
suddenly to turn into a place of pits and precipices.
Oh, Garrett! oh, Garrett!  If ever I were to lose
you now I have got you--!"  She turned burning
eyes to him and in them a glance that held little
of the conventional and much of some primeval
element.  It warmed Westenra through to his
heart and loosened the grip of an icy hand that had
held him all night.  After all there was something
of greatness in this woman's love!</p>
<p class="pnext">Suddenly the brightness slipped out of her face.
She touched his hand a little tremulously, and her
eyes took on the vague far-seeing look of the Celt.
She hated to open up those sad graves of the past
on this sunny morning--the happiest of her life.
But she must carry out her resolution made the
night before.  Afterwards the bright breeze would
blow her words away and drown them far behind
in the deep Atlantic, where they would be forgotten
for ever.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Garrett."</p>
<p class="pnext">He put his hand on hers.</p>
<p class="pnext">"You must call me Joe.  It was always my
home name."</p>
<p class="pnext">Curiously enough, it was a name very dear to
her.  One of the few women she had loved, Lily
Hill, had been by her nicknamed "Joe" and
always so called.</p>
<p class="pnext">"I am so glad.  I love that name.  And you
must call me Val, Joe."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Val," he said gently.</p>
<p class="pnext">"I want to speak to you, Joe--to tell you things
about myself.  You know so little of me--it is
good of you to take me on trust like this--but I
must tell you all about my wandering, vagabond
life, my wretched marriage."</p>
<p class="pnext">His arm stiffened under her hand.  They had
reached the stern-end of the deck, and instead of
turning again he drew her to the taffrail; they
stood facing the vast waste of heaving violet waters
that lay in their awake.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Leave it all behind you, as we are leaving that
troubled sea," he said quietly.  He seemed to
have grown paler, and his mouth looked hard for
all his gentle words.</p>
<p class="pnext">"If you wish it?" she faltered.</p>
<p class="pnext">"I do wish it."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Oh, how glad I should be!  There has been
much in my life that I loved, Joe--my work has
been dear to me and my wanderings.  But there
have been bitter things--and my sorrows--they
hurt, they hurt--it makes me sick to drag them
up from their graves, like sad little corpses into
the sunlight of our happiness."</p>
<p class="pnext">It made him sick too.  It was bitterer to him
than death that in the life of this woman of his
dreams there should be such graves that feared the
light.  He too feared the miserable process of
exhumation.  God knew what ghastly unforgettable
bones might be turned up!  He did not
realise that through this very cowardly fear he was
building up a skeleton to stand between them,
clanking its bones in their dearest moments.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Leave them all, Val," he spoke violently.
"God knows I want to know nothing--only to
make the condition with you that you forget all
your life until we met--that you pull up every
old root--burn every boat?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Yes, yes, I will, Joe--and leave the ruins of
them behind us in that troubled sea, while you and
I sail on in this ship with our love and our dreams
bound for the Islands of the Blest."</p>
<p class="pnext">Her eyes full of hope glimmered up into his.</p>
<p class="pnext">"You must never give a backward glance," he
said harshly.  "Never want to return to journalism
or meet again the people who have been in your
old life.  That is my condition.  <em class="italics">You must leave
all for me</em>.  Is it too much to ask?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"No!  No!"</p>
<p class="pnext">Perhaps he forgot Who it was that first made
that command to men and women alike, and Who
with eternity to offer found few to accept.</p>
<p class="pnext">The "all" life has meant to a woman of twenty-six
is not so easy to leave behind, however much
she may wish to desert and forget it.  You cannot
leave experience behind nor fill the holes it has
made in your heart.  You cannot desert the scars
life has given you, nor divest yourself of her
compensating gifts.  Moreover, Valentine was a
woman who had triumphs to brandish as well as
sorrows; laurels and hard-wrung victories to flag
over the graves of defeat.  Yet none more ready
than she to believe that it could be done, that love
could wipe out suffering and scars and make the
face of life to shine anew like the face of a little
child.  For love she was ready to forswear Art,
her profession, her friends, her past, and forget
that she ever had a career.  Westenra could not
ask too much of her.  Gladly she turned her back
upon the past, and her face to the future, and
gladly she embraced the conditions Westenra
attached.  As she walked the decks of her dream
ship America seemed to her to beckon with the fair
alluring hand of the unknown.  The grim,
undecorative buildings on the Hudson's banks were
faintly veiled in a delicate haze composed of lilac
smoke and autumn sunshine, and for the moment
New York's lack of resemblance to an Island of
the Blest was not too pronouncedly marked.</p>
<div class="center transition">
<p class="pfirst">――――</p>
</div>
<p class="pfirst">Westenra's plan was that she should marry him
at once.  He would not even discuss the idea of
her going back to London to arrange her affairs
and collect her possessions.  She must have no
affairs from thenceforth but his, no possessions
except those he bestowed.  He was afraid of any
trace or shadow of that past life of hers on their
future together--afraid (though he hardly acknowledged
it in thought) of the mud from the old paths,
the vulture-like shadows that had hovered about
the woman of his dream.  In the magic discovery
of their mutual attraction he had forgotten these
things for a while, but too long had he lived with
them for them not to recur and haunt his memory.
Already the skeleton, whose sketchy outline had
appeared to him in the smoke-room of the <em class="italics">Bavaric</em>,
and been filled in later on the decks of the same
ship, was beginning to clank its bones!  But Val
had no suspicion of its existence.  She only
thought Westenra jealous with the natural
jealousy of a man for the life he has not shared with
the beloved.  She could love with fierce jealousy
herself, and so understood.  Entering into the
spirit of the thing, she cast from her with all
the ardour of the unpractical every possession of
the past, every memory sweet or bitter he had not
shared.  She made, by letter, all arrangements
for the letting of her London flat, until such time
as her lease would have run out and her property
could be sold.  But apart from some good curios
and beautiful things she had picked up in her
travels, she owned very little.  As always, she
was living up to every penny of her income, and
her assets were practically nil.  Her name was her
chief asset, and she could never use that more.</p>
<p class="pnext">She was obliged to wring from Westenra permission
to write to Branker Preston, her agent through
whom she conducted all business affairs and signed
her contracts.  Consent was only gained by the
fact that if Preston were not communicated with
in order that he might propitiate the London
Daily, in whose interests she had come to America,
something very unpleasant and public might
happen in the way of a lawsuit for a broken
contract.  As such an affair would have been highly
obnoxious to Westenra, he gave in, but his dogged
and bitter opposition revealed to Val how deeply
he felt on the subject of her past life, and stayed
her from making a further request that was very
urgent in her heart.</p>
<p class="pnext">She had a woman friend, Harriott Kesteven, who
was very dear and near to her, and she felt a great
longing to let Harriott know of her changed life.
She possessed a keen appreciation of the claims
and rights of friendship, and it hurt her deeply
to think how Harriott would suffer over her
mysterious disappearance from the known paths of
her old life.  It was very feminine, too, that
longing to share the secret of her happiness with
another woman, though it was only with Harriott
that she wished to do it.  To let any one else into
the wonder and beauty of it all would have meant
to spoil what was only for Westenra and herself.
However, she resisted the longing to communicate
to Harriott even indirectly what had happened.
After all, that Westenra wished for secrecy was
reason enough to pit against a whole world of
anxious and loving friends!</p>
<p class="pnext">And so they were married in a passionate hurry,
and went away to spend a few days together
before starting the affair of house-hunting.
Westenra, whose vacation was already over, could not
afford the time for a honeymoon in the Adirondacks
which he would have loved Val to see in all
the glory of autumn.  They went no farther afield
than a little house on the edge of Bronx Park,
whence, favoured by mild and lovely weather,
they adventured forth daily into the beautiful
natural woods that skirt this northern point of
New York.</p>
<p class="pnext">To Val at least those were flawless days.  For
once in her life she had got what she wanted, and
the gift had not turned to dust and ashes in her
hand.  Happiness and gaiety radiated from her,
and Westenra, caught in the rays, reflected them
back, so that no one would have guessed that he
was not so happy as she.  Though, indeed, for a
man who has the perilous gift of seeing through
life's red and golden apples to the little spot of
decay at the core, he was extraordinarily content.
And at last now that she was his wife he took her
into his confidence about his life and profession.
Only to a certain extent, however, for he was a
deeply reserved man, and constitutionally unable
to lay his heart and inner thoughts bare (allowing
that such a thing were desirable) to even the best
beloved of eyes.  That he hid this intense reserve
behind frank manners and a witty tongue was a
characteristic of his race.  The Irish are the jesters
of the world, but their laughter is a screen for their
hopeless hearts and the deep melancholy of their
souls.</p>
<p class="pnext">Marriage is full of surprises, and not always
happy ones.  This barrier of reserve that she soon
divined in her husband was one of the things that
amazed Val.  Her own heart was a book ready
to open at the touch of love.  True, some of its
pages were scrawled and scribbled, blotted too in
places and stained with tears; but there it was,
ready to fly open to a trusted hand.  It was not
her fault that Westenra had refused to turn up
those pages, but rather at his wish that they had
been sealed and locked away.  Well! that was
the book of yesterday.  She had begun another
since they met, and there, at least, he might
turn the pages when he listed and read without
misgiving.</p>
<p class="pnext">But she longed and wished that he would trust
her wholly too.  Would let her, if not into the
secret chambers of his heart, then at least past its
outer portals.  Spite of his frank, gay ways with
her she knew well by the subtle and winding paths
in which the minds of women travel, that behind
his deep grey-green eyes there was another Garrett
Westenra whom she had not yet reached.  The
knowledge amazed her but did not daunt her.
Neither did it spoil her honeymoon.  Her faith
in love was of the quality that moves mountains.
In the meantime life was passing dear and sweet.</p>
<p class="pnext">But it was characteristic of each of them that
until the first days in New York Val did not even
know that Westenra was a surgeon.  It sounds
absurd and improbable and everything that is
unpractical; but Val was all of these things, and
the fact is she had never given the matter
five minutes' thought.  She knew he could do
something and do it well: that was written all
over the man, and that was the only thing of
importance.</p>
<p class="pnext">Once or twice, struck by his logic and extraordinary
faculty for stating cases briefly and clearly,
she had vaguely wondered if he were a lawyer.  It
might perhaps be supposed that after her unhappy
experience with Valdana she would have exercised
a certain caution in the choice of a second husband.
Not so--Valentine's was a nature that could never
learn caution.  What she had learned, however,
was a better judgment of men, and she could not
have been imposed upon twice by a man of
Valdana's stamp.  Years of intimate friendship with
men who "did and dared" had taught her to
know unerringly a "good" man when she met him,
meaning by "good," a man who worked with his
brain and heart at some business, or even game,
in which his principles and honour were involved.
In Westenra she recognised the type instantly.
This was no man shirking the battle of life and
seeking a woman to support him!</p>
<p class="pnext">Therefore, if Westenra had announced his
profession as that of a travelling tinker, she would
have been quite undismayed.  Indeed, life as the
wife of a travelling tinker whom she happened to
love would have suited her very pleasantly.</p>
<p class="pnext">As for Westenra, it has been stated that one of
his principles was never to give to fellow-travellers
information about himself that did not concern
them; and on the ship, right up to the last night,
he had essayed to look upon Val as nothing more
than a fellow-traveller; therefore, his profession
was no concern of hers.  Afterwards, when it was
so swiftly settled that she was to become his wife,
the information did concern her, he made her free
of it.  She accepted it as she accepted all things
concerning him, with ardour and pride.  It seemed
to her that she could not have chosen any more
desirable profession in the world for her man.
She had known several doctors abroad, clever and
delightful men, but none of them had happened to
be married, so she had no idea as to what the
special functions and duties of a doctor's wife
might be.  Whatever they were she was quite
ready to tackle them with a stout heart for the
sake of Garrett Westenra.</p>
<p class="pnext">He had taken her to see his bachelor quarters in
the deeps of the city where for years he had lived
and worked.  They were simple almost to bareness,
but Val liked them well.  They reminded her of
her own quarters in London, and she foresaw that
with one good maid she would be able to run her
little home without the risk of Westenra's ever
finding out what a bad housekeeper he had
married.  It came as a shock to hear that he was
considering the matter of leaving these rooms to take
a house somewhere else, near Central Park for
choice, where he could have a fine operating-room
and good accommodation for cases after operation.
It must of necessity be a very large house, with
an efficient staff of servants and nurses attached.
The idea of collaboration with Godfrey had been
rejected.  He had decided to stand or fall on his
own merits.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Would you mind very much, dearest?" he
asked, somewhat diffidently.  "I know it is too
bad to ask you to make your home in a sort of
hospital, but it is for both our sakes.  The only
way surgeons can really make good on the money
side is by having their own place for operations."</p>
<p class="pnext">Something in her dismayed glance made him
add slowly:</p>
<p class="pnext">"But if you dislike the thought, we can have a
home apart from it...."</p>
<p class="pnext">"No, no," she said quickly.  "Of course I
don't dislike it.  I want to be right in your life,
Joe, whatever you undertake."</p>
<p class="pnext">Nevertheless her heart sank into her boots.  Not
for lack of courage, but from a thorough knowledge
of her own inefficiency for so responsible a position
as she might presently find herself occupying.</p>
<p class="pnext">It was their last day in the woods.  The late
afternoon sunlight flickered on them through the
half-stripped trees, and leaves fluttered and rustled
all about the open glade where they sat.  Val,
with her camping instinct, had lighted a little
fire of twigs, just for the pleasure of the sweet
pungent odour of green burning and the sight of
smoke curling blue against the silver sky.  This
sudden news of Westenra's sounded in her ears
like the knell of all camp-fires, and sunshine in
woods and wild places.  Panic seized her
vagabond soul.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Does the money side matter so much, Joe?"
she faltered.</p>
<p class="pnext">He smiled a little grimly.  It had never
mattered much to him, but she could not know that.</p>
<p class="pnext">"It has to matter in New York.  The man who
does n't rustle for the dollars, and rustle
successfully, gets left."</p>
<p class="pnext">She looked at him wistfully.  It seemed to her
that she did not know this rustler for dollars very
well.  It must be part of his hidden self that he
would not let her reach.</p>
<p class="pnext">"I am not a rich man, Val.  I told you that
from the first, did n't I?"  He spoke coldly.  "I
cannot afford to disdain the opportunity that my
reputation affords for money-making,"--he had
almost added "now," but bit back the word in
time.  He was far from intending her to realise
what a change his marriage involved, what a
sacrifice of plans and principles it meant for him
to be emerging once more from the laboratory to
take part in the scramble for dollars.</p>

</div>
<p class="pfirst">The first thing, then, after leaving their
honeymoon woods, was to find a suitable house
for the new venture.  In the press of work that
greeted him on his return, Westenra found it
impossible to give much time to house-hunting,
so this business practically devolved upon Val.
Behold her, then, utterly inexperienced in the
conditions of American life, and without a glimmering
of intuition as to the requirements of an up-to-date
nursing home--whose ideal was a life in the wilds,
sharing the sunshine or the shade of a tree with
her beloved, whose domestic requirements vaguely
included a pot and a blanket, who would have been
more at home on the veldt tracking a buck for
dinner--rushing from one end to the other of the
most neoteric city in the world, inspecting houses
with "every modern improvement," weighing the
advantages of furnace-heating as compared to
steam-heating, examining "open-work plumbing"
and "bathroom extensions," peering into kitchen
ranges and domestic offices, interesting herself
in the things from which all her life instinct had
bade her fly, and from which she had fled!</p>
<p class="pnext">But love was hers and a whole-hearted devotion
to Westenra's interests that even he could not
quench, though he did his best.  Nowhere could
she discover a house that pleased him.  Every
time she found something she thought ideal, he
would emerge for a few hours from his office and
completely demolish her hopes.  Picking her find
to pieces point by point, he would thereafter retire
and leave her to commence the search anew.</p>
<p class="pnext">Few things are more wearing to body and soul
than a prolonged course of house-hunting in a large
city.  There is nothing in the process to feed the
soul and everything to tire the body.  At the
end of a month Val's spirits were several degrees
below zero, and though her smile was undaunted,
there were signs of physical fatigue on her that
did not escape her husband's practised eye.  He
rarely saw her now except in the evenings, for
always with the resolution to shut down firmly on
his old life and its (for the moment) vain
aspirations, he decided against going back, even
temporarily, to his bachelor quarters and letting her share
them, and had instead taken quiet rooms uptown,
near the locality in which he hoped to find a house.
Here he sought her whenever he could escape from
the practice which he was now nursing with
assiduity, but it was nearly always late at night,
and at such times she was nearly half dead with
fatigue, although she tried to disguise the fact
under a gay air.  Westenra's heart was sore for
her, but he could not quite understand the position.
He had realised that, in spite of her nerves, she was
anything but a delicate woman, and it puzzled
and vaguely disappointed him that she should
knock under so soon.  He knew nothing of the
wandering dryad in her nature with whom she
struggled in the house-hunt, trying to school it to
the prospect of life in a nursing home; how the
clang and clamour of New York's street cars,
railways, and fire-bells dazzled and wearied her;
how the actual effort to bear with these things and
keep her trouble to herself wore her down.  In a very
few weeks more, however, a reason that sufficed
him for her fatigue was made clear.  She told him
one night as they drove home from the Metropolitan
Opera House.  They had locked up the house-hunting
problem for a few hours and forgotten it in
the enchantment of a Beethoven concert.  With
the glamour of the 17th Sonata still on them,
making stormy echoes in their hearts, she leaned
her face to his in the darkness, and gave him the
dear and wonderful news.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Since when?" he asked, thrilling into
tenderness and some other poignant sense he had never
known in all his life.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Since the first moment, I think," she whispered
laughingly--"an impetuous Irishman anxious to
get into the thick of the fight!"</p>
<p class="pnext">"How can you be sure it is n't an Irish girl?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Oh, I know--I know.  God will give me a son, Joe."</p>
<p class="pnext">After that, however important the matter of his
private hospital, it was far more important that
the arduous house-hunt should come to an end.
Besides, they were both sick to death of the whole
thing.  So, in a kind of despair at last they decided
on a house which, though it had a very charming
exterior, was inferior in many ways and less
suitable to their purpose than some of those
rejected earlier in the search.  A five-story
residence, it stood towards the Broadway end of
68th Street, and had a beautiful flight of marble
steps leading up to its front door--which was
something to the good; but there was a great deal
in the way of alteration to be done before it was
suitable for a hospital, and the cost of this had to
come from Westenra's private purse.  However,
Val seemed to be drawn to it for some vague,
mystic reason.  Fortunately, Westenra could not
look into her mind, or he would have discovered
that she was congratulating herself on the bird
songs they would hear in the early mornings from
Central Park close by.  That might have irritated
Westenra, for, though he loved birds as much
as any one, he did not allow them to sway his
destiny.</p>
<p class="pnext">Of course, being two thoroughly unpractical
and inexperienced people, they were entirely at
the mercy of that most astute person in the world,
the American Real Estate Agent, and got the
worst possible terms.  The arrangement about
reparations was unsatisfactory, the lease too long,
the rent higher than any one else would have
paid.  Dimly they knew this, and dimly they
knew it would always be so, and that it was a pity
that one or other of them was not practical and
clever in a worldly sense.  Brilliant people often
feel this helpless sense of foolishness, and it
irritates them so much that they long to stab
somebody for it (and they usually stab the person
they love best, with the cruel little knives lovers
keep specially for each other!).  Val remembered
that Westenra in the early days on the ship had
told her that the happiest marriages he had known
of in America were between Irish and Germans,
the Teuton common sense and equability acting
as ballast to Celtic flightiness.  And the
remembrance vexed her.  She saw that as ballast she was
of no more use than a red robin.  She wondered
if Westenra realised it, and one day when the
painful affair of furnishing was going forward she
could not help saying:</p>
<p class="pnext">"Oh, Joe; if I were only a nice, stolid, lumpy
German, I should know by instinct what to buy
for the dining-room and kitchen."</p>
<p class="pnext">Joe froze slightly.  Prescribing wives for your
compatriots is one thing; taking the same prescription
is another, and as it happened he was antipathetic
to Germans.  Nevertheless, since Val had
put the idea in his head, he did think that a little
<em class="italics">hausfrau</em> knowledge of what was fitting furniture
for a doctor's dining-room and kitchen would not
have been out of place in a doctor's wife, and he
said somewhat dryly:</p>
<p class="pnext">"Could n't we try and strike a note somewhere
between stolid and fantastic?"</p>
<p class="pnext">He was thinking of the furniture, but Val
received the impression that her taste was being
indicted.  She took the little dagger to her breast
with a quivering smile, and it hurt her deeply
because she knew that her ideas on furnishing were
indeed fantastic, though beautiful.  Unfortunately
they were all she had, and she was obliged to use
them, for Westenra had none at all.  He only
knew there was something wrong with the furnishing
of the living rooms in his private sanatorium.
Had he ever lived in the Bohemia of big cities he
might have recognised that his drawing, dining,
and reception rooms looked like a series of
charmingly arranged <em class="italics">ateliers</em>.  But, fortunately, he did
not know it.  He only saw that the bills were
amazing, and that was bad enough, for the fact
that nothing but the most modern and expensive
appliances and fittings would satisfy him for his
operating-room had already accounted for a large
outlay of money.  The house needed a good deal
of renovating before it could be used, and by the
time they were settled in their new home there
was a hole in his capital large enough to sail a ship
through, and several rents and tears in the magic
veil of comradeship with which the two had hoped
to wrap themselves from the world.</p>
<p class="pnext">Then began a weary search through guilds and
registries and bureaus, for a staff of capable
servants.  This, of course, was Val's exclusive affair.
Westenra neither could nor would be beguiled into
it, so alone she wrestled with the problem, and
made acquaintance with false references and all
the guile and tricks of the servant class.  For the
American domestic, who is not American at all,
but of every other nationality under the sun, is
truly the worst in the world.  When she is honest
she is a fool; when she is competent she is a knave.
The mistress takes not her choice but her chance of
one or the other; and in either case she pays.</p>
<p class="pnext">After a long series of "weekly trials" which
usually ended in a day or two with a demand for
unearned wages, impudence, and vulgar insults
from the "weighed and found wanting," a
<em class="italics">ménage</em> was eventually established, comprising a
red-haired cook, who, under a bland and benevolent
exterior, was a calculating robber of the most
cold-blooded description, and who, while despising
her mistress for a "soft fool of a greenhorn,"
congratulated herself on the circumstance and resolved
to take full advantage of it; a couple of housemaids
one of whom was raw from minding goats on the
Kerry hills, and the other recommended herself by
a modest demand to be allowed to go to confession
every Friday night.  (The last had subsequently
to be dismissed in spite of her holiness because,
according to her story, she had been "ordered by
her dochtor" to take an egg in brandy for her
breakfast every morning and several times during
the day, and faithfully followed the prescription
except that she omitted the egg.)  There was also
a furnace and general utility man who fought with
both cook and maids, and in the end stole
Westenra's bicycle from the cellar; and a laundry
woman who by arrangement "took two dollars
a day," and appeared to spend most of her time
seated at the kitchen table taking heavy meals as
well.</p>
<p class="pnext">Fortunately event and sequence rarely occur
together, so that Val was not flooded out all at
once by these disquieting things; they fell upon
her from day to day like the gentle drips of water
that wear away the stone.  But life began to press
and gibber in a strangely nightmare fashion round
the vagabond journalist, and sometimes there
would creep into the smoke-coloured eyes that
loved so much to look upon colour and wide
spaces, and "watch the silences," an expression
slightly reminiscent of a wild thing caught in a
trap--a trap full of pots and pans and daily menus,
and weekly bills, and fighting cooks and shirking
housemaids, and domestic problems,--such a
trap as almost every woman finds herself caught
in when she engages upon the career of wife to a
professional man, and one in which few find success
unless specially endowed with an ability for
management, economy, and order.  Poor Val's
endowments were not of this kind.  Well she knew it,
but would not admit the fact even to herself.</p>
<p class="pnext">She had dreamed of a little space of time between
the date of their settling in with their servants
about them and the opening of the hospital--a
little space like the clearing in the midst of a
tangled forest, where she could pitch a tent and
rest for awhile with the thought of her wonderful
happiness that Westenra's child was to be hers.
She meant to recapture into their lives the magic
air of that happy week in the Bronx woods.  Once
more they would adjust and gather about them the
fabric of comradeship and love that was to be the
veil between themselves and the world, and that
somehow in the last few weeks of rushing turmoil
had been mishandled and torn.</p>
<p class="pnext">But the dream was vain.  No sooner did the
domestic mechanism of the house begin to work,
creaking and straining like an old ship with an
amateur hand at the wheel, when cases for operation
were hurried in, the place was filled with nurses,
other doctors and students bustled up and down
the stairs, and there were endless comings and
goings of patients' friends.  The strangely
disquieting scent of ether came stealing down like a
living presence from the upper floor into the
atmosphere of home Val was trying to establish in the
rooms she and her husband occupied in the big
house.  It seemed to her, too, that other shadows
came in and lingered around; that when operations
were in progress pain-troubled spirits wandered
through the house, hiding in corners, waiting fearfully.
In the fight against these illusions, as well
as with the complicated problems of housekeeping
and management, life began to resolve itself
into something very like Swinburne's "Ballad of
Burdens."</p>
<p class="pnext">The burden of fifty-dollar-a-week nurses, rude
and arrogant and of a self-reverence amazing, who
fought like cannibals with the servants, and made
turmoil all round them except in the splendid
silence of the sick room.  The burden of telephone
bells that sounded from morning till night with
the injurious sayings of waiting patients.  The
burden of bitter cold, as the winter came on, and
Val suffered as only a tropical bird or flower can
suffer in a bleak climate--the grim December
dawns when the quiet of three feet of snow lay on
the city, unbroken save by the jingle of the bells
on the milkman's sleigh, or the shriek of the first
car upon the frozen metals!  The burden of the
elevated railway in the avenue close by; the
hideous rush of it through the night, like some
monstrous winged beast on a ceaseless quest for
its prey--the ferocity of its approach, the sinister
melancholy of its receding cry!  The burden of
"bathroom extensions" where the water-pipes
burst every night, dislocating the business of the
house for hours--of frozen cisterns, and New York
plumbers!  Of a cellar furnace that would not
heat the house, or, acting on some æsthetic
principle of its own turned the bathrooms into ovens,
while the patients were in cold-storage and in the
operating-room the sponges froze to the tables!
The burden of snow on the sidewalk, and policemen
knocking at the front door to say it must be
cleared, or that some one had fallen down and
broken something, and compensation would have
to be paid later by the householder!</p>
<p class="pnext">The burden of a beloved man who, when things
went wrong in office or operating-room, came
roaring like a tiger in pain to his mate.  For alas!
Garrett Westenra was no Angel in the House!
That was one of the strangest of all burdens to be
borne, for Val always wanted to laugh at it, and
yet she knew it was no laughing matter.  Westenra
at work and Westenra at play were two very
different persons.</p>
<p class="pnext">Val had been aware from the moment of their
return to New York of a great nervous change in
her husband's mentality.  It seemed to her that
as soon as they got into their new home he became
all nerves and torment, and difficult and exigeant
as a child.  It had not taken her long to find that
he possessed all the easily roused devils of the
easy-going Irishman.  At first she was amazed by
this discovery, then confused, but in the end she
loved him the better for it.  Only it always seemed
to her madly funny that a man with such width
and height of mind should be no better than a
cross-grained baby about some of the ordinary
vexing trifles of everyday life.  It was hard to
believe that a medical scientist of the first water
could fall into a state of fury over a wrongly
entered telephone message, a mislaid stethoscope,
or because a careless housemaid had misplaced
something in his office; that a man who had
nothing small or mean about him should swear
vividly over the fact that some one had put a
used tampon into his waste-paper basket instead
of burning it or thrown a burnt-out match into
his fireplace.</p>
<p class="pnext">There was a dumb-waiter that travelled on a
rope up and down between Val's sitting-room on
the first floor and a little surgery at the back of
Westenra's consulting-room, and never a day
passed but that rope was rattled violently for Val
to come to her little opening and receive some
furious complaint concerning a negligent maid or
a stupid nurse.  Many a time and oft Westenra's
special swear--a peculiar combination of his
own--rang up the shaft.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Hell's blood and blazes!  What has that girl
from the Kerry hills done with my stethoscope?
How dare she touch it?  She must have touched
it--it's not on my desk.--Where are those No. 1
bandages?--Who has moved my note-book?--Will
you find out from Nurse Soames why there
are no tampons made?--Hell's bells!--Is this a
doctor's house?--What kind of a doctor's house?"</p>
<p class="pnext">The dumb-waiter travelled no farther than
Val's room, and she issued orders that no one was
to answer the rattle of the rope but herself.  She
realised that it was Westenra's safety-valve in
moments of intense irritation.  It gave her a
spasm of painful merriment, even in the midst of
her greatest weariness and worries, to hear her
signal to come to the shaft and receive the storm.
Later, when the stress of the day was over, she
might laugh at him, and he, first furious, then
ashamed, would finally laugh himself and beg her
pardon like a generous and hot-tempered boy.
But at the time she always gravely listened, and
without comment put the trouble right as swiftly
as she could.  She realised only too clearly that
the hospital was on his nerves as well as her own,
and that his irritation came from a multiplicity
of cares pressing on him, rather than from the one
small incident that caused the explosion.  Indeed,
life was pressing hard on Westenra.  He was
working like a dog, and the dollars were rustling
in, but the sound of their rustling gave him no
great joy.  His heart was elsewhere, in other
work which must stand still, or perhaps, which
was worse, be done by some one else.  The hospital
hemmed him in it too.  He, quite as much as Val,
felt caged.  His work, his private life, all his
interests for the moment seemed narrowly
centralised into one street, one house, an affair of
grubbing within four walls.  Something in him
rebelled at that, and not less because he himself
had so arranged it.  It irked him terribly to be
mixed up with the machinery of this hospital, and
his reserved nature chafed under the lack of
privacy in the place that should have been his
home.  There were nurses everywhere.  Val and
he were never together for five minutes without
being intruded upon by some one wanting
something.  Val had no control over the nurses; they
did and said what they chose, having fear of no
one but the doctor.  He knew she had trouble with
them every day, but he would not go into the
matter.  It was not his province to wrangle with
women; he had told her so from the first when she
came to him for advice.  She must manage that
part of the scheme by herself, he said; he had his
own share of trouble and could not undertake hers
as well.  She had recoiled wonderingly before
his unsympathetic attitude, but never again
worried him about anything in the house.  But
he was aware that she was having a stiff time, and
from his heart he pitied her.  But what was to be
done?  They were in it now for loss or gain.  His
fortune was pledged to this thing and they had got
to do or die by it.  And he did not mean it to be
die!  Westenra was no quitter.  It hurt Val to
see the way he worked.  She had never realised
before what a dog's life is a doctor's.  Her husband
was at every one's beck and call but her own, and
never could be sure of a peaceful hour to himself.</p>
<p class="pnext">In her own way she worked even harder than
he, and it was a heart-breaking thought that with
it all she was not making a success of the place.
Though money was coming in fast, it flowed out
still faster through her incompetent fingers.  The
problem of how to make things pay was a black
beast which she fought by day and wrestled
with in nightly dreams, and the more she fought
and wrestled the more it grinned and dug its
malignant claws into her heart.  Even courage
and ardour cannot overcome inexperience and
triumph over disability.  Despair came often to
sit with her and whispered that this was not her
place, and <em class="italics">here</em> would never be laurels for her.
But she did not want laurels for herself--only for
Westenra; and the more despair filled her the
more she loved her big difficult Irishman, whose
nerves and torment and prevision for the
rottenness of life's rewards nearly drove her crazy.</p>
<p class="pnext">Bills were another burden heavy in the bearing.
Like all good men, Westenra was "tight with
money."  He never said a word when Val with
heaving heart produced her weekly pile, large as a
roll of drugget, but what he left unsaid during the
short interval between sighting the sum total and
producing his cheque-book would have filled a
library.</p>
<p class="pnext">They were always double what they should have
been, those bills, and triple what they would have
been with an experienced woman at the head of
things: he knew it and she knew it; and they
thought of the stolid, lumpy German, and sometimes
they spoke of her and of red robins that were
no good as ballast!  And she felt as if she were
drawing his heart's blood, and so did he.  Not that
he was mean--far from it; only he realised that his
was not the money-making head, and he suffered
from the fear all brain-workers know--that their
money-making capacity may give out at any time.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Simple people like you and me can never make
fortunes, Val," he would say sadly, "the only
thing for us is to hang on tight to what we have
come by so hardly."  But when he adjured her
earnestly to "try and economise," her face
became as haggard as if he had thrust a dagger
into her, so that he made haste to add:</p>
<p class="pnext">"I know you do, darling.  It is only that I 've
got into the habit of saying it--forgive me!"</p>
<p class="pnext">She forgave him gladly, and lay awake more
than ever thinking out impractical plans for
economising.  She hated to take the dollars that
he had sweated for as only doctors and treadmill
prisoners can sweat, to bestow them on insolent
cooks who stole, housemaids who drank and
shirked their duties, tradesmen who took advantage
of her "English accent" to charge her twice
as much as they would charge other people.</p>
<p class="pnext">When she found that almost every good American
housekeeper defeats the dishonesty of servants
by doing her own marketing, she shouldered the
business too, and made acquaintance with
Baumgarten's Market, a huge place where everything
save groceries could be obtained for household
consumption.  Some of the darkest hours of her
life were spent at Baumgarten's.  It was there,
sitting upon a high chair before the meat and
poultry counter awaiting her turn to be served,
that she most keenly realised her defeat.  All
around her, good American wives were examining
the grain of beef and the breasts of chickens.
Poor Val could never understand how they
extracted information from the process.  She herself
always got the toughest meat and the oldest birds
for the highest prices.  She knew nothing of the
breasts of chickens and never would know
anything.  She, who could write a mile long passage
from the classics and never forget a poet's inspired
word, found it impossible to remember from day
to day the price of sugar, and how much she ought
to pay for butter.  Information like that simply
passed through her head like an express train
through a tunnel.  She never got the bargains
other women got.  She was the victim of every
sharper, and was "done" on every side.  On a
desert island she would have been a treasure.  In
a civilised city, battling with extraordinary
conditions on a professional man's income, she was a
failure, and the knowledge deepened day by day
and was bitter as gall.  She fought on with the
courage of the desperate and the doomed, but
despair was in her heart and her eyes, and
sometimes Westenra saw it there, and thought she
hated this life to which he had brought her.  He
saw that she was a round peg in a square hole,
and the last woman in the world for the practical
life she pursued with the ardour of a doomed
squirrel.  The knowledge never interfered with
his affection for her, but it sometimes interfered
with his nerves.  It was a bad dream from which
they only woke up at night, for then together for
a few hours a natural reaction from the strain of
the day took place, and they would laugh like two
children over the cares and problems of the day.
The night nurses, passing up- and down-stairs,
often wondered what it was the doctor and his
wife found so amusing when they were shut up
in their rooms together.  The fact was that in the
practical affairs of life they were no more than
children, either of them, for all their brains and
experience.  It is often so with gifted people.  Of
course, Westenra knew his business as a doctor--none
better, but the business of being a practical
and responsible husband and head of a household
was a sealed book to him, just as the problem of
how to become the successful manageress of a
private nursing home was one that Val would
never solve.  But if she could not defeat the cares
that the day brought, she could at least be
extremely humorous over her mistakes and failures, and
the valiant spirit of her that was ready to get up
from one day's knock-out blows and face the same
round next morning, could not but appeal to the
chivalry in Westenra, as well as awaken his own
sense of humour.</p>

<p class="pfirst">Acquaintance with a further element in
her husband's life to which she had so far
been a stranger was reserved for Val when at
Easter his adopted child, Haidee Halston, came
home to 68th Street.  Westenra, it is true, had
told her all the circumstances, and no one was
better qualified than Val to appreciate that sense
of responsibility towards the helpless and
unprotected which had prompted him to take upon
himself the entire support and education of a
friend's child.  Westenra and Pat Halston had
been friends from boyhood.  The same county in
Ireland had been their birthplace, they were at
Carlow College together, and, sailing for America
within a year of each other, met again in New
York, and graduated together from Columbia
University, where they obtained their medical
degree.  Later, launched upon the same profession
but inspired by very different ambitions, the paths
of the two friends had diverged somewhat.  Halston,
greatly gifted and of a magnetic personality,
aimed for a fashionable practice that would bring
him social success as well as a fortune with which
to pursue further aims--in fact, like many another
he meant medicine to serve him only as a step to
the more lucrative and exciting profession of
politics, wherefore he followed it only when it led
him into the highways of the rich and influential.
Westenra, on the other hand, inspired by a racial
thirst for knowledge, as well as for eminence in his
profession, did not disdain the by-ways, even when
they led him into the lowest slums of New York.
It was natural, in the circumstances, that the two
men should see little of each other, but the bond of
boyhood held good, and when "Death and
Dismay" all too swiftly and unforeseen came to
Halston, it was to Westenra that he turned at the
last.  Poor Halston had, unfortunately, put a spoke
into his own wheel of ambition by marrying a
lovely, but very flighty English girl, who came to
America as a governess in the family of one of his
fashionable patients.  Halston adored his pretty
wife, but she made ducks and drakes with his
money and brought him to the verge of
bankruptcy through her extravagance.  When death
by septic poisoning swooped suddenly down on
him, she was within a short period of giving birth
to their only child, and the thought of this
darkened the dying man's vision until Westenra, with a
firm hand on his friend's, gave his promise that the
welfare of Mrs. Halston and her child would be
his most sacred task.  Within a few weeks
Mrs. Halston joined her husband in the great beyond,
and Westenra found himself the sole guardian of
the little baby girl fancifully called by its dying
mother--Haidee.  That was ten years before,
and now Haidee was a beautiful, arrogant slip of a
girl with deep dark eyes, a deep dark cave or two
in her soul, and the manners of a cowboy.  The
school at which she had been educated for several
years, to the extreme detriment of Westenra's
banking account, was one of those highly modern
institutions where at the most expensive rates girls
are encouraged to "develop their individuality,"
and Haidee, a hoyden by nature, had developed
hers along the cowboy-brigand line.  Her idea of
argument with servants or other children was to
push them down-stairs or administer a hack on the
shins with one of her extremely useful-looking feet.</p>
<p class="pnext">These unsatisfactory reports had for a long time
troubled the peace of Westenra, whose sense of
responsibility to Pat Halston's child was perhaps
a slightly exaggerated one.  A vague idea had
occurred to him of sending her to a convent to see
what the gentle influence of nuns could do for her,
but Haidee jibbed like a mule at the mention of
nuns, and declared darkly that if he sent her to a
convent <em class="italics">he would see</em>.</p>
<p class="pnext">When he spoke to Val of his worries on the
subject she said, ready at once to embrace any
project or protégé of his without thought of the
fresh tasks entailed:</p>
<p class="pnext">"Oh, why not have her here for awhile, Joe?
A little home life will tame her down, I expect.
Look how it has tamed even such a wild ass of the
desert as I," she added, with a gay smile in which
there was more than a touch of wistfulness.  But
Westenra said a trifle abruptly that he did not
fancy somehow it would be a good plan.</p>
<p class="pnext">"You have enough worries already," he added,
but not quite quickly enough to prevent Val from
perceiving that there was some other reason,
though she was far from guessing what that
reason might be.</p>
<p class="pnext">In the end, however, by the gift of circumstance,
Haidee came to 68th Street after all.  For at the
expiration of the Easter term the school authorities
wrote a brief but eloquent letter to the effect that
they wished to be relieved of the care of Westenra's
ward.  If it did not exactly amount to an expulsion,
it certainly could not be looked upon as a
certificate of good conduct for presentation at her
next school, and for the moment all thought of the
convent had to be dismissed.  So Haidee came
home from New Jersey, bag and baggage, and
utterly unashamed of her peccadilloes.  Val,
with a heart open for anything or any one loved by
Westenra, was eager to mother the motherless
creature of whom she had heard so much.  But
Haidee was apparently not in search of a mother,
and received her advances coldly and in a
keep-off-the-grass manner that only an American-bred
child would have the <em class="italics">sang-froid</em> to use.  More than
a hint of hostility, too, was to be found in the
deep-set eyes, when they watched Val and
Westenra together.  The fact was that to find her
guardian installed in a house with "a strange
woman" had given the girl a great shock.
Westenra, following his usual habit of reserve, had
prepared her for nothing of the kind when he said,
on his return journey from New Jersey:</p>
<p class="pnext">"I am married now, Haidee."</p>
<p class="pnext">She never dreamed that such a thing would
make any difference to her absolute monopoly of
her beloved guardian, and indeed, because Val
was generous and he was kind, it would have made
but little, if she had not instantly determined to be
as obnoxious and tiresome as she could be, in the
hope that Val would get tired of her and go away.</p>
<p class="pnext">From the first she nobly contributed her share
towards the business of making life at No. 700
more unlivable than it was already.  She fought
with the servants, got into the way of the nurses,
and disturbed the patients with her noise.  A
day-school was found for her near at hand, and
that kept her energies employed for a certain
number of hours, but her new teachers were soon
on the war-path after her, and she arrived home
daily, flustered with combat, and bringing long
accounts of their tyranny and brutality!  When
it was time for her to go to school in the mornings
the house had to be hunted for her from top to
bottom by Val or a housemaid.  She hated to go to
bed, and there was a scene every night before she
could be induced to do so; then, on being left
alone, she would invariably hop out again, turn
up the lights, and amuse herself in some illicit
fashion, such as hanging out of the window and
dropping things on the heads of patients coming
up the front-door steps.  Yet in the mornings it
almost needed a charge of dynamite to dislocate
her from her blankets.  She had a rooted aversion
to taking baths, and would never brush her teeth
unless some one stood over her and saw it done.
In fact, she had all the faults and naughtinesses of
an ordinary child strongly accentuated, and a sense
of perversity extraordinarily developed.  Withal
she was as clever as paint, and grew prettier every
day.  What vexed Val most was that everlastingly
she broke in upon Westenra, claiming his attention
for her troubles, her lessons, her amusements,
unless Val were on the alert to prevent it.  She
would wait outside his office door and slip in
"between patients" to relate some woe, and
Westenra would listen patiently and in the end the
trouble evaporated into smiles and laughter.  But
this wasted his time and told upon his temper in
some later affair of the day, or brought him up to
bed a little more tired than usual.</p>
<p class="pnext">Presently, too, Haidee's jealousy of Val's place
in Westenra's life began to take a more active form,
and if it had not been for her disarming innocence
of mind where worldly matters were concerned,
Val would have almost come to dislike her.
Instead of which she felt pity for the child who, in
her adoration for Westenra, resented being ousted
from the central position in his life.  Haidee
could not or would not understand why a mere
wife should have first claim.  She considered that
she herself possessed it, because she had been first
in Westenra's life.</p>
<p class="pnext">One night Val, going to her husband's room to
see that everything was prepared for him to go
straight to rest as soon as he got in from a late
consultation, found Haidee in her nightgown,
curled up and scowling, on Westenra's bed.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Haidee!  What on earth--?  I thought you
were in bed and asleep long ago."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Well, I 'm not, you see," was the surly response.</p>
<p class="pnext">"But, dear chicken, what are you doing here?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"I 'm waiting for Garry."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Oh, Haidee, how silly!  When Garry comes
home he 'll be dead tired and not want to be
bothered.  You really must have a little consideration
for him, dear--besides, you ought to be in
bed and asleep by now."</p>
<p class="pnext">The child suddenly burst out at her like a
tornado:</p>
<p class="pnext">"Why aren't <em class="italics">you</em> in bed and asleep, I 'd like
to know ... why can <em class="italics">you</em> wait up for him and
not me? ... I know ... you think he
belongs to you ... and that you can have him all
the time.  You are a greedy guts.  You have
him every night ... why should n't I have him
sometimes?  You are trying to take him right
away from me.  Who asked you to come from
your rotten old England and take my Garry away
from me?  Before you came he was all mine
... when I was little he used to let me sleep with my
arms round his neck.  But now, whenever I ask if
I can come and sleep in his bed he laughs and says
I have grown too big and active with my hoofs.
But your hoofs are not too big, I suppose!  Oh,
no! ... and he 's not too tired, however late he
comes in for <em class="italics">you</em> to come to his room and talk to
him....  Mean pig that you are ... greedy
guts!  I hate you ...  and I <em class="italics">will</em> sleep
with Garry ... I will, I will!"</p>
<p class="pnext">She burst into a torrent of tears, and Val stood
staring at her in amazement that swiftly softened
to pity.  The trouble with Val was that she could
always feel sympathy for another person's point
of view, and that frame of mind is very disarming
to anger.  Immediately she threw her arms round
the sobbing creature and began to comfort her.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Dear old thing, you mustn't feel like that
about me.  I don't want to take him away from
you.  I know he is all you have.  I only want you
to help me as much as you can to make things
easier for him.  Think how he works ... for
both of us--you and me!  And how tired he is
at nights....  As for my coming to his room
... dear chick, don't you understand that I am
his wife?  When you are grown up you 'll marry
some nice man ... and you 'll want to be
greedy over him too a little bit."</p>
<p class="pnext">"I 'll never marry anybody.  I always meant
to marry Garry ... and now <em class="italics">you</em>--"
Vindictiveness came into her voice again, and Val's
heart gave a little weary sigh, for she was dead
beat, and this was her legitimate time of rest, hard
wrung from the day.  To have to face this
exhausting scene late at night seemed very much
like the last straw that was one too many for the
camel.</p>
<p class="pnext">However, it was urgent to get it over and done
with before Westenra came in, so she stayed on
talking to the unhappy child, trying to beguile
her from her misery and once and for all place
their relationship on a footing of sympathy and
affection.  It seemed almost a hopeless task, but
in the end the effective thing was that she told
Haidee of what so far she had spoken to no one
but Westenra--her deep, sweet, secret joy in the
thought of the child that was coming.  It was
Haidee's first glimpse into the workings of nature,
and she sat wide-eyed and dumb, searching Val
from top to toe for circumstantial evidence, while
Val, with a faint flush in her pale face, but
serene-eyed and in simple words, following on Carpenter's
advice in <em class="italics">Love's Coming of Age</em>, made all clear to
the child.  She even, with a touch of guile, let
Haidee into the secret of suffering to be endured
before the baby could come into the world, believing
that to touch the heart of the child to a little
sympathy might not be an unwise thing.  And she
was right: from sympathy to compassion is a
natural step, and Haidee went to bed in a glow of
good resolution to be as helpful and considerate
as possible in the days to come.  Indeed, without
turning into an angel, or even a moderately good
child, she did improve greatly in behaviour during
the next few months, while waiting with burning
impatience for what was to come when the bleak
spring days were over.</p>
<p class="pnext">June came at last, and brought its gift to
Valentine and Westenra--a son.  Like an impetuous
Irishman, as Val had declared, anxious to get into
the thick of the fight, he had practically started
their married life with them, and arrived as soon
as compatibility with schedule permitted.  That
was a great day in the Westenra household when
the golden head of a baby lit up like a star the
gloom of dark and difficult ways.  Instead of one
baby, indeed, there were three.  Two of them
haggard and thin, but content and care-free as
the third in that glad hour of love made incarnate.
Even Haidee softened and turned into a real child
as she hung with perpetual curiosity over the cot
of the new-comer.</p>
<p class="pnext">"It's got blue eyes, just like the lion cubs in
the Zoo....  Oh, look at it clutching on to
me!  You are lucky, Val....  I wish I could
get one, too.  Oh, <em class="italics">could n't</em> I have it to sleep
with me?"</p>
<p class="pnext">She sulked bitterly when she was not permitted
to take charge of it to play with like a doll, and
thereafter constantly complained to Westenra of
Val's greediness.</p>
<p class="pnext">"You 'd think it was all hers--and how can it be
if it is half yours?  And if it is yours it belongs to
me too," was the burden of her complaint.</p>
<p class="pnext">When Val got up and resumed life again, the
question of a name for the baby arose.  Val was
all for Patrick.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Patrick seems to stand for Ireland, and he is
our link with Ireland, Joe."</p>
<p class="pnext">"It is an unlucky name with us," Westenra
objected.  "My father was crazy for sons, but
three he called Patrick died one after the other.
When I came they took no more risks, and gave
me an old family name.  Choose another, Val."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Well," she said shyly, after a little thought,
"would you mind Richard?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Richard?" he mused.</p>
<p class="pnext">Val had long yearned to talk to Westenra of
Dick Rowan, only the ban he had placed on all
past things had so far prevented her.  But that
the day must come when no subject would be
taboo between them, she felt confident.</p>
<p class="pnext">"We could call him Dick," she said.  "I once
cared very much----"</p>
<p class="pnext">Westenra turned on her like a flash, white to
the lips.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Is that the way you burn your boats?" he
said, in a low, hard voice, and looked at her with
furious eyes she did not know.  While she stared
at him in pain and amazement he rose abruptly
and left the room.  Slowly her eyes filled with tears.
She made no further reference to the matter.  She
did not know what to say.  It seemed she could
not refer to that time and tell him who Dick was,
and how good he had been to her without giving
pain.  Therefore it was better to be silent.  On
the day of the christening itself he said:</p>
<p class="pnext">"We 'll call him Bran if you like, Val--one of
Ireland's old savage kings.  I think that son of
yours will be some one fine some day," he added
with a boyish, lovable smile, that had something
of pride in it, and something of humility too, and
for those words Val forgave him and was happy
again.  And the baby was baptised into the Holy
Catholic Church under the pagan and kingly name
of Bran.</p>

<p class="pfirst">There is a saying that during the hot weather
every one in New York, except doctors and
cats, leave the city.  Westenra, with his yearly
habit of pulling stakes and heading for Europe at
the first hint of heat, had always been an exception
to this rule, and he invariably advised other men
that his was the only possible way to keep fit after
nine months' hard work.  But now, though the
brazen heat beat down on to the city and burnt up
through the pavements as if Pluto had lighted a
special furnace under New York, Westenra laughed
at his own advice and made no move to get away.
Val knew why, and the knowledge etched new
shadows under her salient cheek-bones.  In spite
of his working like a bee from morning till night,
the Sanatorium being constantly full, and operations
always in progress, Westenra was harassed
for money.  The venture did not pay.  An
experienced woman at the head of things could
have made it pay.  The stolid, lumpy German with
a good hospital training grafted on to a knowledge
of household affairs would have made a roaring
success of it, and coined money for all concerned.
Even an ordinarily good manager with free hands
and no nerves might have achieved a margin of
profit.  The vagabond journalist not only could
not make it pay, she was turning it into a dead
loss.  Every day good money went cantering after bad.</p>
<p class="pnext">What Westenra should have done, even at that
eleventh hour, was to engage a capable, working
matron to manage the place, while Val devoted her
loving fervour to the baby and himself.  But he
felt doubtful as to the success of such an arrangement,
first because Val would probably not like to
live elsewhere; secondly, because he had managed
hospitals before, and knew all about trouble with
matrons.  Experience had taught him that in
America women rarely work well except in the
interests of some one with whom they are in love.
This rule applies very pertinently to American
nurses, who are usually middle-aged Germans
intent on marrying a doctor; but it may very
well be applied to women all the world over, though
Westenra was not aware of the fact.  What he
did know was that a managing matron would
probably work for her own hand and not for his.
Even if she made a roaring success of the place,
later there would surely come the subtle introduction
of other methods and other interests than his,
into his own hospital.  Worst of all would be the
fact of strangers within his gates spying out the
secrets of his reserved nature, bearing witness to
his moods and nerves, all the irk of daily contact
with people who were making a business out of
his brains.  This idea of outsiders being "let in
on him," of alien eyes coming close enough to look
over the wall behind which he kept his conflicting
tempers and emotions from the world, was peculiarly
irritating to him.  Only Val, privileged by
love, must have the gift of a share in his torment,
the right to hear his swears.  With all others he
smiled and smiled and hid his heart, and put
distance between himself and them.  And Val,
because she was a true lover, understood and
faithfully gave of her body and soul to pad the bumps
of life for him.  Whatever else she failed in, she
failed not in playing the buffer between him and
the strangers who went to and fro in his house.
He little knew what it cost her in peace of mind
and serenity of spirit, this jarring with natures so
unlike her own, and jangling with those who were
making a business of life.  He only knew that in
spite of her impracticability and extravagance
there was no one like her, and that the place in her
incompetent hands was dearer by far than it could
ever be in surer hands that were strange.  It was
beginning to dawn in his heart, with the exquisite
promise of the skies, all that she was to him, this
woman who walked by his side never faltering,
smiling gallantly in defeat.  It was beginning to
whisper through his senses like the haunting echo
of bells whose cadence he had known all his life
that defeat after all did not matter so much since
he shared it with her--that it might in fact become
a form of victory.  In any case he meant to
struggle on with things as they were, hoping and
working for the best.</p>
<p class="pnext">Unfortunately, his nerves after the year of
extraordinary strain were in rags.  He really
needed the rest and change that was due to him.
His body and brain clamoured for it, and his fine
athlete's skin took into itself a putty tint that
was neither healthy nor becoming.  In vain did
Val implore him to take ship for his native land.
He laughed and refused to go unless she and the
children went too.  But she knew what the cost
of such an exodus would mean, and sat tight as an
eagle in her eyrie; and her little brood pecked at
her heart as though determined to get at her
life-blood.  Haidee grew wickeder every hour, and
Bran was the naughtiest baby in the world, sleeping
all day and howling all night, withal drinking
away his mother's strength and blooming on it like
a pink rose.</p>
<p class="pnext">Valentine grew pale as a wraith and Westenra's
old, haunting fear that his brain would give out
ate him by night and day; but neither of them
was a quitter.  Both possessed that stupid and
over-estimated kind of courage that does not
know when it is beaten.  At last Fate, like an
overtried mother who is sick of giving gentle hints
to unheeding children, brought down her hand
heavily upon them.  First she smote the man.
In the blasting heat of late August, Westenra went
down as only the big and the strong can go down--like
a felled oak.  The brilliant colleague whom
Val hastily and fearfully summoned to her husband's
bedside expressed his diagnosis in the argot
of the day.</p>
<p class="pnext">"His nerves have run out and his stomach has
gone back on him.  If he does n't slip up on us it
will be a near thing, Mrs. Westenra."</p>
<p class="pnext">And it was a near thing.  If it had not been for
Val, Westenra would have found eternity sooner
than he expected.  But it was a bad time for her.
In addition to nursing her husband, she had to
manage the rampageous Bran, a domestic crisis
brought about by a servant strike, and an ice
famine.  Fortunately, there were no patients but
one in the house at the time, and the nurse in
attendance happened to be an exceptionally good
one, who did all she could to relieve the strain.
She was an English woman, a Miss Holland, with
an able brain behind a pretty, calm face.  She
would willingly have undertaken the nursing of
Westenra besides her own patient, but he was so
frequently delirious that Val was afraid to let any
one share in the nursing of him.  She knew how he
would hate any stranger to hear his tormented
ramblings, but she did not realise for a long time
that it would perhaps have been better at any cost
that another than she should have heard them.
For all that he had hidden from her came out now
in broken snatches and groans, half dream, half
delirium.  She learned of his longing for his
laboratory, of the sacrifice it had cost him to
abandon it, of his despair about the Sanatorium, money
worries, all the irk domestic life held for him.
What was more terrible, she gleaned in broken
fragments, halting and disjointed, as though even
in his delirium he had an instinct to hide it,
something of the way he had struggled with himself to
evade her coming into his life, of his mental resistance
until the last, of the pity which rather than
love had moved him to ask her to marry him, of his
dread of her past, and fear for their future.
Oh! bitter and bleak were the things that came to her
ears in scraps and broken whispers and heavy sighs,
and that pieced together by her weary yet quickened
brain made a clear writing on the wall.  All
was plain to her at last: all that he had succeeded
in keeping dark from her, the secret of his torment
and his pain in the struggle.  To her the upholding
joy in the darkest hour had always been that the
man was worth it, she loved him and considered
him worthy of every sacrifice she could make.  She
saw now that he had had no such thought to
uphold him.  Though he had been too loyal to
acknowledge the fact even to himself, the bitter
drop in his cup must have been his belief that the
woman was not worth the sacrifices marriage had
entailed!</p>
<p class="pnext">Sighs and dark mutterings told her why he had
shrunk at first from Haidee's coming to 68th
Street--some duty he had to Halston, to keep his
child only among those whose lives had been pure
and unspotted by the world.  The meaning of his
fury at Val's suggestion for his son's naming came
whispering forth from fever-broken lips.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Dick! ... How <em class="italics">could</em> she?  A dissipated
brute .... no woman safe from ... and
she ... my woman, alone with him for months
... wild places ... lonely places."</p>
<p class="pnext">She could not know where he had heard that
scandalous tale.  She could only bow her head and
take the sword to her heart.</p>
<p class="pnext">When she heard him muttering to his mother,
explaining that she was his dream woman, that it
had to be....  'She is not like you, mother,
but she came to me in dreams ... <em class="italics">it had to be</em>
...  and now she is Bran's mother ... you
must love my Bran's mother," she thought her
heart would break for bitter aching.  It seemed to
her in that dark hour that nothing could ever hurt
her any more.  She defied Fate to do her any
worse hurt.  An unwise thing to do.  Fate was in
fact sitting in wait with a worse clout in her hand.</p>
<p class="pnext">There came an afternoon when Westenra was so
much better that he could talk a little, softly, if a
trifle vaguely to Haidee who had crept in to hold
his hand.  His eyes, seeming to have grown lighter
in his thin, strongly-featured face, travelled
incessantly round the room, resting here and there as
though they recognised landmarks in some country
he had not visited for years.  They rested on
Val writing at a table near by, and noted the
wraithlike face, pale as a bone, the weary lean of
her against her own supporting arm, the droop of
her lips and her shoulders.  When she came over
with the medicine, he said quietly:</p>
<p class="pnext">"You should go out for a little while, dearest.
Haidee will take care of me."</p>
<p class="pnext">She had indeed a longing that was almost active
pain for air and the sight of sky and green things,
and needed little persuasion, seeing that he was
really better.  She did not even stop to change her
frock, which was old and unfashionable, and in her
haste caught up an ancient school-hat of Haidee's,
trimmed with a shabby bow of silk ribbon, and
more than slightly bent out of shape about the
brim.  She felt it mattered little how she looked,
so long as she could escape into the outer air.
Her head ached violently.</p>
<p class="pnext">As she hurried down the front-door steps, a man
walking up the street looked at her curiously, and
something in her peculiar walk brought a flash
of amazement to his eyes and quickened his steps.
He was tall and well-dressed, with traces of
breeding, and a certain dashing handsomeness about
him, but there was a green tint in his ravaged
cheeks, and the straight figure under the well-cut
coat was gaunt and shrunk.  His eyes lacked
lustre, and one of them jerked and winked
mechanically at irregular intervals.  The man was a
nervous and physical wreck.  As he passed the
house from which Val had come, he looked up and
noticed its number and the name on the door-plate.
A moment later he caught up with the slight,
hurrying figure, gave a swift glance at her profile
and the shabby hat above it, then, in the quiet
drawling tones of the man about town, he said
politely:</p>
<p class="pnext">"How do, Val?"</p>
<p class="pnext">She swung round with the wild jerk of a lassoed
creature and faced him.  Then he was not so sure
after all that it was Val.  The grey-faced woman,
with all the life gone out of her eyes, sunken cheeks
and blanched lips, was certainly not the Valentine
Valdana of other days.  The figure, the walk was
hers; but the face was the face of some strange
woman--some woman in trouble, too, and that was
a bore.  He was a man who always avoided women
in trouble.  On the point of lifting his hat, with a
slight apology and walking away, her words
detained him.</p>
<p class="pnext">"<em class="italics">You!</em>"  Her voice was the voice of Valentine
Valdana with all the music gone from it: harsh
and grinding as stone on stone.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Yea, verily," said he, and stared sardonically
into her fearful eyes.  They stood so for a moment
staring at each other.  Then the man laughed;
but it was not a pleasant laugh.</p>
<p class="pnext">"You don't seem as pleased to see me as you
ought to be!"</p>
<p class="pnext">"You!" she stammered again.  It seemed all
she was able to say.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Yes, <em class="italics">me</em>, my very dear Val," he repeated with
something like a snarl.  "Time appears to have
dimmed your excellent eyesight, as well as robbed
you of your gift of repartee!"</p>
<p class="pnext">She answered strangely, speaking vaguely like
a woman in a nightmare, but her words struck
home like little, sharp knives, and the blood
mounted high in his dark cheeks.</p>
<p class="pnext">"So <em class="italics">you</em> were the slinker in the bush!--the
skulker!--the deserter of comrades and men!--<em class="italics">I
might have known</em>!"</p>
<p class="pnext">Rage flashed out of his bloodshot eyes, and for
a moment he looked as if he could strike her.
Then he laughed again the jeering sardonic laugh
of the cynic, whose bones hard words have no
power to break, the coward who fears nothing but
death.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Be damned to you!" he said pleasantly.  "I
had as much right to save my skin as any one else."</p>
<p class="pnext">"<em class="italics">No one else saved his skin</em>."</p>
<p class="pnext">"That was their lookout," he remarked with
grim facetiousness, but her silent, terrible stare,
so full of indictment, disconcerted him horribly.
He essayed to change the unpleasant subject.</p>
<p class="pnext">"So you are in New York!  No one could make
out where the deuce you had got to."</p>
<p class="pnext">That detached her from the sinister question of
his conduct on the South African veldt.  But still
she stared deep into him as if seeking in his soul
the key to some problem she could not solve; and
he was embarrassed, for he wished no one to search
in his dark soul--there were things hidden there
that even he was afraid to look upon.  As for the
situation, surely it was clear enough.  He that
should have been dead was alive, and that was all
there was to it.  He had been looking for her to
let her know, and that he had found her by accident
was so much to the good.  It had a better
appearance than if he had hunted her down (as he would
have done if he had possessed any clue to work on).
After all, he argued to himself, he had a right to
her sympathy.  Also he needed help in the shape
of money pretty badly.  He was sick of hiding in
America, and longed to get away to the cheap
comfort of Europe.  Unfortunately, she did not look
as if she could help his financial situation very
much.  He had, in fact, never seen her look so
shabby since she ceased to occupy the proud
position of wife and slave to Horace Valdana,
Esq.  The thought that he might not be able
to levy a loan from her after all moved him to venom.</p>
<p class="pnext">"I fear you have come down in the world, my
poor Val!  If I did not know what a brilliant
woman of letters you are, I might almost think
you had turned into a housemaid.  What were
you doing at Number 700?"</p>
<p class="pnext">Then she realised he had seen her come out of
the house.  That was the key she had sought.
Now she knew just where she stood, and what
she must do.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Yes," she said slowly, "you are quite right,
I have come down in the world, and I am a
housemaid--at that house I have just come from."</p>
<p class="pnext">He burst out laughing.  It seemed to be the
funniest news he had heard for a long time.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Indeed!  Perhaps you will invite me to call
and have some supper with you and the cook
some evening?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"We are not allowed to have callers.  I don't
get on with the cook.  I am under notice to
quit."  She made her statements quite gravely.</p>
<p class="pnext">"But this is great!"  He began to laugh again
uproariously.  "So you have got the sack!  And
now you will have to go back to the career of
famous journalist.  But why have left it, my dear girl?
Is it a joke, or some new craze for getting copy?"</p>
<p class="pnext">Steadily, calmly, with pale lips and toneless
voice, she lied on--for Bran's sake, for Garrett's
sake, for the sake of all she held dear.  What
better reason can a woman have for lying her soul
away!</p>
<p class="pnext">"No, no joke, no craze: stern necessity.  I can't
write any more, that is all.  I had brain fever,
and when it was all over I found that I could n't
put another sentence together.  I am done for as
a writer.  So I just dropped out of the old life and
disappeared.  The only thing I can do now is work
with my hands."</p>
<p class="pnext">"But"--he stammered.  "But it will come
back--all you want is time, rest--"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Never," she said firmly.  "Never.  It is
finished.  My brain is gone.  I am Alice Brook
now--Alice Brook, housemaid.  I shall never be
anything else."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Good God!"  He gazed at her aghast.  There
was no glimmering of doubt in his mind as to the
truth of her story.  It seemed almost too
extraordinary to be true, but he had never known Val
to lie.  He was aware, in fact, from painful
experience that she despised liars, and held a creed
that nothing worth a lie was to be found in the
world.  It was not for him to know that she had at
last found something she considered worth lying
for.  Besides, she so thoroughly looked the part.
Thin, hollow-eyed, and badly dressed, with the
hopeless lines unhappiness had sketched about her
lips, she was the picture of an overworked slave
who worked too much by day, and got too little
rest at night.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Good God!" he repeated blankly.  "And I
was going to touch you for my fare home."</p>
<p class="pnext">It was her turn to laugh now, and she did it
silently, rocking from side to side, holding one
hand over her heart as if afraid it might burst from
her body in its wild mirth.  Valdana considered her
with shrewd, savage eyes.  He had never known
her guilty of such a thing as a fit of hysterics, but
it looked uncommonly as if she meant to indulge
in one now, and he was not anxious to assist in
anything of the kind.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Don't be a fool, Val," he said sharply.  "Pull
yourself together.  Come along into the Park
and we 'll discuss things."</p>
<p class="pnext">Val's laughter was over except for a strange little
sobbing sound that escaped from her lips from
time to time, as she walked slowly by his side
towards the Park.  Sometimes she swayed a little
and put out her hands as if to keep herself from
falling--as though the earth were rocking under
her feet.</p>
<div class="center transition">
<p class="pfirst">――――</p>
</div>
<p class="pfirst">There is a story told in Africa of a Dutch woman,
who, during one of the early Kaffir wars, escaped
from an attacked township, and with her family
of six little children hid in the bush.  They
concealed themselves in a deep swamp overhung with
bushes and seething with poisonous gnats; and
there, while all round them human beasts beat the
bush seeking for prey, the little band crouched
low, nothing but their heads protruding from the
filthy ooze, fearful almost to breathe lest they
should be heard and dragged forth to torture and
death.  Unfortunately, the baby, sick and too
young to understand the terrible situation, whimpered
endlessly at the bites of the insects, and all
its mother's fearful hushing could not quiet it.
With the howls of blood-drunken Kaffirs in her
ears, and before her eyes the five tragic,
terror-stricken faces of her other children, the distracted
mother found no other thing to do than clasp her
hands about the little loved, whimpering throat
that would betray them all, and still its cries for ever.</p>
<p class="pnext">Long after Valdana had left her Val sat on in the
Park, trying not to think, trying to get control over
herself.  Her overwrought brain felt like a
struggling, tortured thing, determined to burst from
her head and run brandishing its frenzy and pain
to the world; while some other part of her strove
for calm, hushing and pacifying the tortured
thing as the Dutch mother had hushed the child
that would betray them all; and she felt that if
she could not still its frenzied cries she must kill it.
Better that she should die than that Westenra
and little Bran should suffer.  But she did not
want to die; she knew she could not be spared at
that time.  The mother of a little child can never
be spared.  Westenra, lying weak and ill, seemed
to her no more than a little child too, and one that
she must care for and protect from trouble.  Dazed
and shocked as she was, with her world in pieces
about her, the mother sense alert in her warned
her to get control of her nerves; that it would
be fatal to fall ill now; that everything
depended upon her deliberate action.  She had seen
with Westenra what happened when the brain
was sick, and she knew she could never hope to
keep the truth from him if such an illness overtook
her.  She was resolute to keep it from him.  He
had suffered enough.  He was sick and broken
with suffering, and all through her.  But his pride
and joy in Bran was still left him; and of that, if
she could help it, he should not be robbed.  His
son!  Heir to an old and honoured name if to no
great fortune.  What would befall if he found that
his son was nameless--heir to nothing but shame
and sorrow.  Ah! some day he might have to hear
the truth and bear it--but not now, not now.  She
must take herself in hand strongly, force herself
to calmness, plan how to outwit Valdana, and save
her loved ones.</p>
<p class="pnext">She looked at the card Valdana had given her
with an address written on it:</p>
<p class="left medium pnext white-space-pre-line">MR. JOHN SEYMOUR,</p>
<dl class="docutils left medium white-space-pre-line">

</dl>
<div class="vspace" style="height: 1em">
</div>
<p class="pfirst">He was there under an assumed name, skulking, as
he had skulked in the bush.  His mother, the
only person whom he had enlightened as to his
being alive, was secretly sending him money.  She
dared not let his father, an old man dying of an
incurable disease, know, for fear it would hasten
his end, and she was ashamed to tell her other sons
and daughters; they were all honourable, upright
people whose heads would be lowered to the dust
under the blow.  With a mother's unselfish love
she wished to spare them the truth--that the man
whose gallant death all England had mourned was
alive and skulking in hiding, a coward who had
deserted his comrades!  But for Val she had no
such feeling, and it was she who had given him the
news of Val's sailing for America and paid his fare
to do the same, counselling him to find her out and
get her help.  She said it was Val's duty to stand
by him, and he, pleased with such comfortable
counsel, had been in New York six months hoping
to come across his wife.  At the last moment he
had chanced upon her by accident!</p>
<p class="pnext">He had left her in the Park; it was with the
understanding that she was to meet him in two
days' time at Shrapp's Hotel.  But she had no
intention of keeping the appointment.  First of
all it would be extremely difficult for her to get
away from home without lying, and then there
was a possibility of Westenra finding out where
she had gone, and suspecting something strange.
She meant to take no risks where Westenra was
concerned.  Secondly, she hated to meet Valdana.
Quite apart from the horrible turmoil his reappearance
caused in her life, she was shakingly revolted
by his presence.  The sight of him alive when he
should have been where the world believed
him--among the heroic dead--made her physically sick.</p>
<p class="pnext">"<em class="italics">As much right to save his skin...</em>" she
repeated blankly, and the blood seemed to turn
to water in her veins.  "Oh, I might have known
... I might have known!  Mean souls do not
suddenly become heroic!  <em class="italics">To save his skin!</em>"</p>
<p class="pnext">And it was the name of such a man that she
bore by law!  For such a one her little Bran
must be branded illegitimate.  She ground her
teeth in rage and despair, and gave out a little
moan.</p>
<p class="pnext">Around the black morass that surrounded her
there showed only one small glimmer of light--it
was the remembrance of that faint gleam that
kept her from going mad.  He had offered it as a
sort of propitiation for the fact of his being still
alive, and she shuddered at her own heartless
catching at it.  She might not have believed but
for the bleak tint of his skin.</p>
<p class="pnext">"It won't be for long, anyway.  I 'm booked,
Val.  I have the same trouble as my father--cancer
of the liver.  Nothing can save me.  It's
only a matter of a few months ... a year at
the outside."  She had looked into his face keenly
at that and recognised the possibility of his words
being true.  That strange hue in his cheeks might
easily be the hue of death foreshadowing the
atrocious malady from which his father suffered.</p>
<p class="pnext">He had gone on to tell her that all he asked was
to be allowed to live in peace, out of the world's
sight, until his hour came.  The truth must never
be known, he said.  Even he was not so dead to
decency that he could not recognise that.  He
owed something to his family after all--to say
nothing of his country!  These had a right to
expect silence from one who should have been
dead.  And he was willing enough to be silent.
The gnawing at his vitals had killed in him, he said,
all taste for gaming and dissipation.  He only
wanted peace in some quiet country place,
anywhere but America, which he hated with the fierce
hatred of the waster surrounded by active energetic
men.  He had, it appeared, sought Val in the
pretty certain belief that she could and would
assist him to the quiet life he longed for, and when
he found she could not he was more inclined to
curse than to sympathise because her brain had
"given out."  She smiled a tortured smile at that.
Her brain had indeed given out.  That part at
least of the story was true; and that she would
never be able to write again as in the old days she
knew was true too.  There is nothing like a year's
tussling with domestic problems for dulling the wits.
She felt that to earn a sure million she could not
have produced the energy or material for one of
her old gay vivid articles salted with wit and scented
with the breeze.  The power had gone from her.
Wifehood had absorbed it.  Maternity had eaten
and drunk it up!  Like Alice Brook, she could
only work with her hands now; and, like Alice
Brook, she was sadly incompetent even with these.
For there really was a housemaid called Alice
Brook at No. 700; an inefficient English girl
who could not get on with the cook, and was
without the faintest notion of her duties.  As Val
had no time to train her she was obliged to give
her notice, and the girl was in fact leaving the
house that night.  This was why Val had felt so
safe in her story.</p>
<p class="pnext">When Valdana found out that she did not mean
to meet him again, he would probably, as
discreetly as he dared, make inquiries at No. 700
for Alice Brook.  But Val would be prepared for him.</p>
<p class="pnext">She sat still on that bench in Central Park until
she had formed her plan.  She would write to him
within the next two days saying that nothing was
to be gained by their meeting; that she had left
68th Street, and that if he did not worry her and
try to find her, she would help him all she could
with money, and from time to time send him,
through his mother, such sums as she could earn.
There was no question, of course, of her earning
at present, but she possessed jewellery upon which
she could raise certain sums.  She would pawn
some at once and send him fifty pounds for his
passage to England, thus ridding herself of his
vicinity at least, and gaining untainted breathing
space in which to decide upon the next move.
There must, she knew, be a terrible reconstruction
of her life with Westenra, but as yet she was too
weary and shocked to see far ahead.  She only
knew that she must go warily, like</p>

<p class="pfirst">Recuperation set in at last with Westenra,
and he began to return to health almost as
swiftly as he had departed from it, and with health
came a full tide of love and gratitude to the woman
who had so devotedly nursed him back to life.
But in the wraith at his bedside he hardly
recognised Val.  She had strangely changed, yet
poignantly recalled to him that grey lady of long ago,
whom in the past months of pain and fevered rush
he had almost forgotten.  Shadows seem to hang
about her as in his dream.  Almost it seemed as if
she, instead of he, were returning from the Valley
of the Shadow.  He was struck to the heart by her
worn and weary look.  But when he put out hands
of gratitude and compassion to her, she seemed
like the dream woman to elude them without
moving.  A long, long distance came between
them.  The old sad ache of lost lands was in her
eyes and lingered about her lips.  Consciousness
came upon him suddenly that he loved this woman
deeply, that she was the very heart of his heart
... then why should he have that sense of fear
that she was escaping from him?</p>
<p class="pnext">She smiled at him with exile in her eyes when he
took her hand, and kissing it, thanked her for
all her goodness to him.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Bless you, dearest and best ... I am
ashamed of myself for getting sick like this ...
to have had you half-killing yourself nursing me
... what should I have done without you?
What would I ever do without you ... Brannie's
mother?"</p>
<p class="pnext">Was it his fancy that her hand seemed to grow
a little rigid in his?  That a shadow passed over
her face?  He had called her the sweetest thing he
could think of, one that meant so much to him, the
symbol of their love, the treasure saved from
the rocks that had broken and wrecked them--the
treasure with which they would build a new ship
in which to sail the stormy seas.  He could not
know that ever since the days of delirium she had
been yearning for some little word of <em class="italics">personal</em> love,
some little name that was all for her as lover, not
mother only.  Once more the sense of distance
between them came to him.  She seemed suddenly
to be a long way off.  In effect, he had loosed
her hand and she had moved away to the window.
He did not see the heavy tears that scorched her
eyes, but he noticed the droop of her shoulders
and reproached himself.</p>
<p class="pnext">"I 'm killing her," he thought sombrely, "and
she is sick of it!  Sick of nursing me, and of her
life here!  How can one blame her!  I only
wonder it did n't come sooner.  How could I ever
have hoped to keep a woman like her ... to
make a slave of ... in a doctor's commonplace
home!"</p>
<p class="pnext">He closed his eyes again and the swift despondency
of the invalid welled up in him.  When she
came back to his sofa the old moody shadow was on
his face, the look of strain back about his brows.
Timidly, and with her face turned from the light,
so that he might not see the trace of her tears, she
said:</p>
<p class="pnext">"Is there anything you would like, Joe?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"No, thank you, dear ... I have you!"  He
spoke gently, and put out his hand to her without
opening his eyes.  A moment later his sombre
thought escaped from him almost involuntarily.</p>
<p class="pnext">"I have you--though God knows for how long!"  Then
he waited for the touch of her lips on his, the
rush of tender reproach for his unfaith.  He did
not indeed know how passionately hungry he was
for those words--until they did not come!  Nor
how his lips ached for the touch of hers--until
that long, still moment of waiting!  Nothing
happened; nothing came.  No kiss, no word of protest.
He could scarcely believe it at first.  If he had not
still been holding her hand, he might have
supposed that she had risen and gone away.  For he
had not opened his eyes, but lay waiting as
sometimes one waits with eyes closed for the coming of
a beautiful thing.  The knowledge flashed upon
him suddenly that it was a long while since Val
had kissed him.  So long, that he could scarcely
remember when.  Was it before his illness?  No:
looking back down the vista of burning days of
fever and discomfort, he could remember that
before unconsciousness came upon him her fresh
mouth was often laid like a rose upon his dry one
and at the memory he longed again for its fragrance
as a thirsty man in the desert longs for a cup of cold
water.  He was aware that when at last she did
bend over him he would bind his arms round her,
and holding her fast to his heart devour and
consume her, and never let her go from him again.
But in the same moment he was seized with the
torment all true lovers know, the agonising
knowledge that however much the lips may devour
and the arms bind, and the heart strain to hold
there is a limit to the reach of human love, a door
to which the key will never be found, a barrier
beyond which the aloof and lonely soul of the
beloved sits stern and contemplative, for ever
lonely in its secret place.  This is the torment of
all earthly love.  No true lovers but have sought
in each other's eyes the key of that implacable
door, striven to drag the secret from each other's
lips, known the darkness and desolation of that
outer place!  Lying there, waiting for his wife's
kiss, Garrett Westenra suffered this torment for
the first time.</p>
<p class="pnext">It was characteristic of him that when at last
he understood that she meant to make no response
either by word or deed to the cry of his heart so
thinly veiled beneath the sadness of his words,
he did not question or upbraid her.  He only lay
very still, turning over and over in his mind the
cruel fact that she was weary of him and of their
life together.  Between his half-closed lids he
observed her, silent and white, looking down at the
hand which, tightly held by his, lay on her knee.
He realised then how fierce his grip had been, and
relaxing it gently drew away his hand.  What good
to grip the casket so close when the jewel it had
held for him was gone!</p>
<p class="pnext">"What do you think we had better do, Val?"
he said at last, speaking out of his pain, and
meaning "with the rest of life."  He did not expect so
quick and definite a response as she made.</p>
<p class="pnext">"I think that as soon as you feel well enough to
travel you should go out West, and stay until you
are quite strong again."</p>
<p class="pnext">"You and the children too?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Oh! no, no!" she cried hastily--too hastily
with so keen a listener intent on her.  She saw her
mistake and tried to cover it with calm reasoning
words.  "What change would it be for you with
us everlastingly at your heels?  Bran rampaging,
Haidee worrying--and I--oh, of course, it would
not do at all.  You must see that."  Her
arguments might have sounded silly but for their
urgency to convince, and her pleading eyes.  He
stared straight before him, but missed no single
shade of her face or voice.</p>
<p class="pnext">"We will stay at home and mind things," she
continued, "and be quite all right, until----"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Until?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Until you come back...."</p>
<p class="pnext">"And then?"</p>
<p class="pnext">She knew she ought not to let him draw her on,
that it would be better to wait until he returned,
but she was an honest creature by nature, and
though circumstances were plunging her deep in
duplicity, she had not yet learned to conceal and
wait.  Besides, she wanted to get the pain over,
the thing settled and done with, past recanting.  If
he were cold and angry so much the better for
her.  It would be easier to bear than if he tried
to detain her with kind words.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Then," she stammered, "Garrett, I think, we--the
children and I--ought to go away for awhile
... to England, or France perhaps--some place
where living is more reasonable than here, and I can
get strong again, and be of some use to you...."</p>
<p class="pnext">No word from him.  He did not even raise his
eyes.  So she stumbled on hopelessly, embittered
by his silence and misunderstanding, longing to
have him see how much she cared, how it broke
her heart to make such a suggestion, yet fearing
that he would combat it.</p>
<p class="pnext">"You know, Garrett, that I am no good in this
place ... never have been.  Later perhaps
when I am strong again I may be of some use
... when Bran is older....  You must see
for yourself ... I cannot manage the house at
present--(I have always mismanaged it)--with
Bran wanting so much attention.  It would be
best to get one of your good nurses to take charge
... anybody could do it better than I...."</p>
<p class="pnext">So she had it all planned out!  She had arranged
for "the rest of life" without consulting him!
All the time he lay sick she had been plotting to
escape.  Small wonder he felt the return of her
old elusiveness, had become aware of distance
between them.</p>
<p class="pnext">Separation!  That was to be the end of the
voyage in the dream ship--of his life with the
dream woman.  Had it all been a dream perhaps?
... a dream full of dark places, with thorns for
the flesh and pits for the feet ... but always--that
was good to remember in this dark hour--always
stars overhead.  The stars had never
before failed though they were dying out now.
So she was a quitter after all!  A deserter!
Unfaithful to the post she had chosen.  Somehow
he could never have believed it except from her
lips.  It was hard to believe, looking at that face
softly hollowed by weariness and worry, the
faithful deep eyes, the tender lips, the hands grown
diaphanous in his service.  Nothing had been too
hard or base in his household for those hands to
strive with, he knew that.  And how she had
nursed him!  That he owed his life to her was
certain.  And now, so soon, so soon, she nullified
all, her tenderness and devotion, the precious
unhappiness, the sacred sacrifices--the wonderful
bonds that trouble shared can make, everything
was broken and rendered void by this act of
desertion!</p>
<p class="pnext">It must be remembered that he came of a race
of women who had, so to speak, habitually lived
heroic lives.  The men of his family, never able to
offer ease to their women folk, expected heroism
and self-sacrifice of them, and no Westenra woman
had ever failed the expectation--<em class="italics">until now</em>!  Yes,
that was a thought that hurt.  That ate like acid
in an open wound.  Val was not one of <em class="italics">them</em>!
His wife, the woman on whom he had staked his
honour and belief, was not of the stuff of which
Westenra wives were made!  Until that hour,
spite of failure, trouble, and disappointment, he
could have sworn away his soul on her loyalty--what
did the mere failure of plans, or lack of money
matter, when they had each other, were content to
tread the same road together, the same ideals in
their hearts, their eyes fixed on the same stars!
And by God he could have sworn ... but what
was the use!  She had proved his judgment wrong,
that was all.  She was just the ordinary woman,
sick of her job, anxious to get away from it.
"Lots of women like her in America," he reflected
sardonically.  No one who knew the circumstance
could blame her.  He least of all would blame her.
Only--his soul was sick within him!  But, as
always, he hid his wound from her.  Not a sign
of what he felt when at last he spoke, quietly,
reflectively, almost it sounded to her, approvingly.</p>
<p class="pnext">"No doubt it would be a very wise arrangement."</p>
<p class="pnext">She had been twisting her hands in nervous
agitation, her beautiful, strange eyes full of the
ardour that had always been like wine to him,
though he had never told her so.  Now a rush of
words came from her lips, she was almost
incoherent in her gratitude.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Oh, Joe! ... if you think so ... if you
won't mind ... it will not be for
long ... only six months or so--a year perhaps."</p>
<p class="pnext">He stared at her in bitter astonishment.  (Only
a year perhaps!  Why not ten years--twenty
years--the rest of life?)</p>
<p class="pnext">"I will take such care of your Brannie for you....
I 'll never let him forget you for a
moment ... and I 'll come back so different ... ready
to tackle any problem ... you 'll see
what a clever housewife I will be."</p>
<p class="pnext">(He did n't want a clever housewife.  He had
believed he did, but now he knew that all he
wanted was Val.  He had arrived at desiring
nothing better than her fantastic housekeeping
and gipsy camping-out methods.  She had spoilt
him for comfort and set rule.)</p>
<p class="pnext">"We must get some one to take charge of the
place ...  Miss Holland is a splendid woman....
I know she will make a success of it ... and
before I go I will find you a good housekeeper
who will look after you well."</p>
<p class="pnext">(Before she went!  Oh! damn it, why should she
look at him like that, as though it were for his
happiness she was arranging instead of her own?
As though planning loyalty instead of desertion--treachery!
How could she smile--gladly, gratefully,
when she was taking herself out of his life,
robbing him of the light of his son's golden head!)</p>
<p class="pnext">"And if you will let me have Haidee? ..."
she spoke more diffidently now.  "I fear she will
be a care to you.  I would do my best for her----"</p>
<p class="pnext">"No!" he interrupted sharply, "if you take
Bran I must console myself with Haidee.  I
should think you could spare me her, at least!"</p>
<p class="pnext">She turned white as death.  Haidee to take
Bran's place with him!  Their son--her love-baby--to
be exiled from his father's heart as well as
from his home!  Of what use then all her plotting,
her secret grief and suffering endured, that father
and son might be spared.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Oh, Joe!  Oh, Joe!" was all she could say.</p>
<p class="pnext">He stared at her incredulously.  He had no idea
she was so fond of Haidee.  It seemed indeed as
if she could be fond of any one but himself!  He
was thankful that Haidee herself made an end to
the miserable discussion by bounding in at the
moment and embracing him boisterously.</p>
<p class="pnext">"And can I bring Bran in?" she cried, as soon
as she had finished hugging him.  "He 's just on
the stairs.  Nurse has brought him home from his
walk ... he looks such a duck in his new pink
pelisse."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Yes, bring him in," said Westenra, heavily,
but a moment later, when his son was sprawling
on the bed thrusting fat fists into his father's
eyes, exploring his father's nose and ears,
moodiness departed from that father, and he began to
laugh like a boy.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Just feel that leg, Haidee ... muscle--sheer
muscle.  I tell you this fellow is a hot number.
He 's going to make the athletes sit up and take
notice; are n't you, old man?  Hi! that's my nose!"</p>
<p class="pnext">"He smells like a nice ripe peach!  Oh, would n't
I love to eat him!" shrieked Haidee, and hugged
him until Val had to call out a warning not to
crack his ribs.  She stood watching them, unshed
tears scorching her eyes.  They were so dear, so
very dear, that man and child; and Haidee too
was dear for loving them so well.  It was pain
even to look at them.  Their dearness burnt like
flame.  She felt that if she stayed in the room a
moment longer she must fling herself down by
them, cry out the truth to Westenra, tell him she
could never leave him, nor rob him of his son.
But that way madness lay.  Sorrow and shame,
worse things than separation for a time, must
come of that.  No, she must bear it alone.  Her
hand was to the plough and she must not turn
weakly back.  Even now there was that to do that
was part of the plot, and she must leave the dear
ones to go and do it.</p>
<p class="pnext">"I think they can spare me for a little while,"
she thought, not without a certain tender irony,
for the crowd on the bed were so very wrapped up
in their own performances.  Unnoticed, she slipped
from the room, and went to Westenra's office to
typewrite a letter.</p>
<p class="pnext">When she did not keep the appointment at
Shrapp's Hotel with Valdana, he had, as she
foresaw, called at No. 700 in search of Alice Brook.
On hearing that she had left, he asked for an
interview with Mrs. Westenra.  Fortunately, Val
had not been with Garrett, but in her room resting
with a bad headache, when the new maid, a
Wicklow girl of good type, who had developed a
great devotion for her mistress, brought in the
card.  By an effort Val had managed to control
herself and look with calmness upon the inscribed name.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Mr. John Seymour!  Who is he?  What does
he want, Mary?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"I don't know, ma'am, he did not say, but sure
it's a sick man he is by the colour av him."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Go down and find out.  If he is a patient, tell
him the doctor is very ill and will not be able to
see patients for a month or two at least.  If he is
in a hurry he had better go to Dr. Dillon, who is
seeing all Dr. Westenra's patients at present."</p>
<p class="pnext">This gave her time, and would she thought allay
Valdana's suspicion, if he had one, of any
connection between herself and Alice Brook.  But she
was sick with apprehension and lay white on her
pillow when the maid reappeared; the answer was
as expected: the gentleman's business was not with
the doctor, but with the mistress of the house.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Sure, it's the character of the last housemaid
he wants, ma'am.  He 's afther engaging her,"
Mary announced and Val's heart gave a great
jump of fright.  The next moment she realised
that this was most likely a ruse, a mere excuse
for finding out what he wanted to know of her
whereabouts.</p>
<p class="pnext">"The character of Alice Brook?" she said
mechanically.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Yes, ma'am.  And I took the liberty of telling
him, ma'am, that you could not be plagued with
such affairs now, and you destroyed nursing the
doctor and all, and he 'd better be afther writing
for what he wants."</p>
<p class="pnext">Val could have embraced the kindly creature,
but she gave no sign, only said quietly:</p>
<p class="pnext">"You did quite right, Mary.  But to save time
you may tell this gentleman, Mr.--," she looked
at the card--"Mr. Seymour, that as far as
character goes Alice Brook was quite a good girl--honest,
sober, an early riser, diligent (she could
not forbear a wry smile to think that in the last
three points at least the formula applied equally
to herself); her chief defect was that she was quite
ignorant as to the duties of a housemaid, and I
had no time to train her.  I cannot think of
anything further that it is necessary for him to know,
but if there should be he can write."</p>
<p class="pnext">As the maid was leaving the room, she added
thoughtfully:</p>
<p class="pnext">"Don't let him linger asking questions, Mary.
It seems a curious thing for a gentleman to be
occupying himself with a housemaid's references.
He may not be what he professes at all, but some
scamp----"</p>
<p class="pnext">She knew that upon that hint Mary would polish
him off without ceremony, and she felt no
compunction in giving it.  Could any one indeed be
a worse scamp?  What was he there for but to spy
out and blackmail, and cause ruin and dismay to
her and her loved ones?  She trembled with rage
and terror when she thought of him being in the
same house with Garrett and Bran.  But for an
accident she might have been seen by him, or his
card brought up to her at Westenra's bedside!
There was no reason for him to have come to the
house at all.  True, she had not kept the appointment,
but she had kept faith with him in the matter
of money, had sold a greater part of her jewels, and
sent him the proceeds by registered post.  At the
same time she had written him a letter telling him
firmly that there was nothing to be gained by their
meeting.  She reminded him that all question of
their being anything to each other was over many
years past, and that certainly the circumstances
of his reappearance did not incline her to renew any
kind of intimacy with him.  In consideration of
his health she promised she would do her best for
him, and spare him any money she could.</p>
<p class="pnext">"But it is no use hounding me," she wrote, full
of the cold fury of a mother robbing her loved ones
to give to a wolf, for the money gained on her
jewels would have paid many a bill hanging over
the household at the moment.  "You must not
forget that I too need to live.  And you are not to
torment me.  If ever I make money again I will
let you have all I can, but I do not hold out any
great hope.  In the meantime take this, and leave
America with it.  If I have anything to send you
I will do so through your mother.  But leave me
alone--surely you have caused me enough sorrow!
All I ask is to be left alone."</p>
<p class="pnext">Thus she had written in her agony and desperation,
and sent with the letter the sum of one
hundred and ten pounds.  Yet a week later he
was on the doorstep intent on tracking her down!
Well, she had cut the ground from under his feet
by her message through Mary.  With the
information he had asked for concerning Alice Brook he
had no further pretext for calling at the house,
or even writing.  Not that she relied on that.
Horace Valdana had failed in all honourable things,
but never in lies, pretexts, and inventions.  She
could hardly suppose he would do so now.  As
the event proved, she was right.  For two weeks
there was silence.  Almost she had begun to hope
when there came a letter, polite but formal, asking
if Mrs. Westenra would have the kindness to
oblige the writer with the home address of her
late housemaid, Alice Brook.</p>
<div class="vspace" style="height: 2em">

<p class="pfirst">"She had been in my service for ten days or so"

perhaps you can tell me from what agency you

what a cynical smile he produced that tag of
history from the rag-bag of his memory, and made it
serve his purpose as a nom-de-plume.  For though
the name of good King Hal's third queen might
or might not have been borne by one of America's
fair daughters, the writing was the writing of
Horace Valdana!  It was one more attempt to
get on to the trail of his victim.</p>
<p class="pnext">The address at the top of the letter was Number
439 West 19th Street--the same number in fact as
Shrapp's Hotel; but of course Mrs. Westenra
would not know this.  She was to suppose it the
number of the private house occupied by Mrs. Jane
Seymour!  No doubt Mr. John Seymour would be
on the lookout for Mrs. Jane's correspondence!</p>
<p class="pnext">This was the letter to which she now typed the
following answer on her husband's typewriter:</p>
<div class="vspace" style="height: 2em">
</div>
<p class="pfirst">"MADAME,--I beg to state that I can give you
no information concerning the whereabouts of my
late housemaid, Alice Brook.  When I have once
supplied a discharged servant with a formal
reference, I feel that my responsibility to her is at an
end.  I must, therefore, request you to relieve me
of all further inquiries upon a subject in which I
have neither the time nor inclination to interest
myself."</p>
<div class="vspace" style="height: 2em">
</div>
<p class="pfirst">This missive, designedly as rude and arrogant
as she knew how to make it, she signed with a
hieroglyphic signature in which might be
discovered after careful study some resemblance to
"Anne Westenra" (her second name was Anne),
but that was quite unlike any signature ever put
on paper by Valentine Valdana.</p>
<p class="pnext">In the end she almost spoiled all by one of those
absent-minded mistakes that sometimes betray
the best laid plots and plans.  She addressed the
envelope in her natural handwriting.  She had
stamped and closed it and risen to ring for Mary
to take it to the letter-box at the end of the street
(for since her <em class="italics">rencontre</em> with Valdana she had not
dared go out), when, with her hand on the electric
button, some bell in her brain rang a warning that
something was wrong.  She stared at the letter
in her hand for a full minute before she recognised
her <em class="italics">bêtise</em>, then the shock sent her back to her
seat half fainting, pale as a witch.</p>
<p class="pnext">"What an escape!  What an escape!" she
muttered with dry lips.  "I must be going mad!
My brain is giving way!  Oh, if I had posted it!"</p>
<p class="pnext">Valdana would have been quick to recognise her
writing and see through the whole thing--<em class="italics">that
she was Mrs. Westenra</em>.  All would have been lost!</p>
<p class="pnext">"But I would have torn down the letter-box--set
fire to it--blown it up--rather than he should
have got the letter," she muttered fiercely.  In
that moment she knew herself one of those who in
the cause of love are capable of crime; that there
was not anything she would not do to save her son
from being branded illegitimate and Westenra
from shame.  But she was shaken to the depths
by her narrow escape, and the thought that any
moment her overtried brain might betray her.  It
was clear that she must depart as soon as possible
from New York.  Her presence there was a danger.
The moment she reached England she could
communicate with Valdana's mother, and once he
found she had gone from America, he too would
make for Europe.</p>
<p class="pnext">From that day forward a gulf yawned between
Westenra and his wife--a gulf into whose depths
every sweet memory they had ever shared seemed
to have disappeared.  The only things that could
have bridged it over were confidence and love,
but he no longer believed in her love, and she could
not give him her confidence.  Desperate and
dismayed, she saw the chasm widening day by day
between them, but though her spirit held out arms
to him imploring his love and belief in her loyalty,
and in her eyes she could not quench the light of
tenderness, she stayed firm to her purpose.</p>
<p class="pnext">And Westenra felt the spirit arms entwining
him, and saw the beacon in her eyes, and cursed
her for a false trifler, a juggler with the arts and
tricks of women.  For when he approached her,
lured by the beacon, she retreated, subtly
intervening between them that sense of distance.  And
she was cold as death to his touch.  Her hand,
if he took it, lay like a stone in his, her lips eluded
him.  They were to all intents and purposes
strangers to each other.  She had never kissed
him since he came back to the world of consciousness!
What could he suppose but that her love
for him was worn out.</p>
<p class="pnext">All her kisses were for Bran it seemed.  She
would at times almost violently snatch the child
from his arms, and kiss it feverishly, hungrily,
just where he had kissed it, as if to drag the flavour
of his lips--or as Westenra bitterly thought,
remove all trace of them--from the little face.</p>
<p class="pnext">He was a proud man, and his pride sustained him
in this dark and incomprehensible crisis of their
life together.  With extraordinary self-control,
born of his pity for her, he refrained from reproach
or any violent sign of his inward rage and pain;
but often a sort of primitive savagery in him ached
to smite the eyes that mocked him with their false
tenderness, and there were moments when he
longed to take her by the throat and kill her, while
he kissed the lips she withheld from him.</p>
<p class="pnext">Life was in fact an active wearing misery to them both.</p>
<p class="pnext">He was once more sound in health.  His plan
was to go softly under the stars for awhile and
perform no serious operations, but he felt quite equal
to taking up the ordinary threads of his practice
again.  His main worry was Val.  Her resolution
to go to Europe meant not only the <em class="italics">bouleversement</em>
of home and hospital, but of their whole future
life.  He was far from wishing to keep a woman
who did not care for him tied to his side.  But he
retained a kind of ungrounded hope that after
she rested awhile from the heavy strain his illness
had entailed, she would gradually return to her
old, ardent generous self and give up the fantastic
plan for leaving America.  He saw very well that
she must go somewhere.  Her physique was in
rags.  She had grown so fragile that her bones
almost pierced her skin, and her face was the face
of a ghost.  His heart was wrung with pity for
her.  None more anxious than he that she should
go away and rest, and to use his last cent for the
purpose if need be.  What hurt was that she
should want to go so far and for so long; that
she should have planned it all so eagerly while he
lay sick, and hold fast to it so resolutely now that
he was well.  Once so pliant to all his wishes she
was firm as a rock in this, and he had no will to
oppose her.  His heart was always tender for the
sick, and it was plain to the dullest eye that she was
a sick woman.  He schooled himself to believe at
last that her strange coldness was a result of this
sickness.  He had half-killed her with overwork
and worry, small wonder that she hated him!  It
was not treachery, not the quitting spirit, but the
whim of a sick and weary child.  The generous
thing was to bear with her unreproaching, and at
whatever cost to himself, humour her wish.  It
was in this spirit that he told her to pack up, and
he would, when she gave the word, take steamer
tickets for her and the children.  He arranged
for Mary, the Wicklow maid, to accompany her too.
He would have offered to go himself, though he
knew the hospital needed him, but that he could
feel her projecting a very stone wall of opposition
to such a purpose.  He had almost to insist on her
taking Haidee at the last, for she seemed now to
hang back from the idea, looking at him with
strange eyes when he said that Haidee would be
better in her care than any one else's.  How could
he know that his delirium had betrayed to her old
doubts of his, which in sane moments he would
himself have been ashamed of harbouring, and
which had long since been banished from his mind
by her bright gallantry.  He had come to believe,
indeed, that Haidee was better with Val than with
any one.  Further, he did not in the least want
Haidee with him.  She would not for one moment
comfort him for the loss of Bran and his wife.
He had only said the thing in that first bitterness
of heart.  Rather he looked upon Haidee's going
as a safeguard to his own happiness, for if Val's
illness grew worse, the child would be able to give
him the news at once.  Mary was going only for
the voyage, and on arriving at Southampton
would go straight on to Ireland where her mother
needed her.</p>
<p class="pnext">When he found at last that Val's reason for
lingering in New York was that she was not
satisfied with the people she was leaving behind to
take charge of the house and his comfort, he
summarily, even savagely, turned on her and told her
he was well able to take care of himself.  Indeed,
he considered this anxiety for his welfare somewhat
forced and unnecessary.  Well she knew what he
needed for his welfare--that it was neither a good
cook, nor a housekeeper, nor a matron for his
hospital--and, knowing it, she still went from him,
betook herself out of his life, put the ocean between
them!</p>
<p class="pnext">And so at the last, on one grey day late in the
year, it was almost in bitterness they parted,
haggard and broken, hiding their hearts from each
other.</p>
<p class="pnext">As the White Star liner steamed down the river
he stood on the dock and waved farewell to the
little group that now made up his dear portion of
life; Haidee, all long tags of hair, yelling
boisterously; Mary holding up Bran pink and shining;
Val, wraith-like in her long grey silk cloak, seeming
among her veils to be floating rather than leaning
from the side of the ship, her hands put out at the
last in an involuntary gesture as of entreaty--for
what?  Forbearance, forgiveness, understanding?</p>
<p class="pnext">"God knows what is in her strange heart!"
thought Westenra.</p>
<p class="pnext">A gleam of light struck on something bright
she wore--he recognised the beads of her weird
necklace.  The comfort necklace!  He had never
seen her wear it since the day she had swung it in
her hand as they walked the deck of the <em class="italics">Bavaric</em>.</p>
<p class="pnext">Poor Val! was she too in need of comfort then?</p>
<p class="pnext">Was she thinking of the dream ship on which she
had sailed so confidently into this very port not
two years gone?</p>
<p class="pnext">He turned heavily away.</p>

<div class="vspace" style="height: 2em">
</div>
<p class="pfirst">Jersey, a small and smiling island set amidst
the boisterous seas of the English Channel,
is reputed to enjoy more winter sunshine than any
seaside place in Great Britain.  Be that as it may,
for the first few months of Val's residence there,
it wrapped itself so perpetually in soft warm
shawls of mist, that she sometimes thought of
writing to Rudyard Kipling and calling his
attention to a place where the sun never so much as
rose on the English flag.  However, it is one of
the cheapest spots in the world, and that is why
Val chose it for her six months of waiting before
she could tell Westenra the truth.  The six months
might possibly resolve themselves into twelve, one
never knew!  She was not hard-hearted enough
to wish that Valdana would hurry his departure
from the world, she only wished not to think about
it at all.  Jersey seemed to promise both peace
and solitude in which to pull herself together after
the strain of the last few months in New York.</p>
<p class="pnext">They had sailed there straight from
Southampton, and after a week's hunt, found a little
furnished house out in the country, pitched high above
St. Brelade's Bay.  It was isolated and lonely,
standing in the midst of its own wide fields and
garden.  The owners, army people who had used
it for a sort of pleasure farm or summer residence,
were now in India, and the property having
remained unlet for some time was in a neglected
condition.  The house was scantily furnished, but
against this fact the low rent was an offset.</p>
<p class="pnext">Jersey is considered extraordinarily picturesque,
but Val, spoilt by the wild scenery of Africa,
majestic even in its barest, bleakest places, found
the scenery pigmy though pretty.  However,
there was always the grandeur of the sea, beating
in fury against the rugged, red coast, and the
gracious misty emptiness of sky-line and horizon.
She loved, too, to stand in the garden, dreaming
of the lost land that lies sleeping under the water
between Jersey and Brittany--that land of past
centuries, which, before the sea in some strange
empyrean convulsion swept over it, included
forests in which were hordes of wolves, the "city
of a hundred churches," and that wonderful
cathedral in which, according to an old Breton
manuscript the scarlet mantles of forty Lords of
the Church could be counted at Mass every
Sunday.  At the great neap tides Jersey fishermen,
far out, looking down from their boats into the
clear depths, say they can still detect foliage that
is not sea-weed swaying amid the branches of
mighty forest oaks; and from the Brittany side,
on still days keen eyes have detected, far down on
the sea floor, the walls and ruined towers of the
city of St. Ys.</p>
<p class="pnext">But there was little time for dreaming at Cliff
Farm.  Val, with a resolution to cost Westenra as
little as possible, did nearly all the work of the
place herself, only employing a woman two or three
times a week to do rough cleaning.  But not
content to economise only, she thrilled with a scheme
to augment their slight income.  A yearning to
found a successful poultry and rabbit farm seized
her soul.  Haidee, bitten by the same mania,
fostered the ambition, and with heads together
over a poultry journal they read rapturously of
fortunes to be made in this direction.</p>
<p class="pnext">The first and vital thing, however, was to regain
health and get the children well.  Travelling had
not agreed with Bran the pagan.  On the ship he
had been dreadfully sick and lost all his plumpness
and lovely colouring, but in the mild mists of
Jersey and Channel breezes, fresh and unpolluted
by the microbes of cities, he began to bloom again.
Haidee, too, pallid when they first arrived, changed
under the spell of the country.  Like all persons
who had been held long in cities she felt the joy
of the open, of trees, and grass, and living things,
and began to blossom and smile into a different
creature.  The old savage Haidee was still there
under the skin, ready to come forth if scratched;
but reasons for kicking physically and jibbing
mentally were wonderfully absent in the simple
farm life.  Her only grievance was that she had to
go in daily to school at a convent in St. Helier,
from whence she invariably returned ornamented
with scowls.  But these passed as soon as she
got back to the work of digging and delving in
the garden.  It was the out-of-door work that
put Val right, too, painting a faint colour in her
thin cheeks, and laying dew on her jaded nerves.
The kitchen garden, practically a field, was heavily
infested with couch grass, but by noble efforts they
cleared it and began in time to have their own
vegetables for the table.</p>
<p class="pnext">Val had told Westenra that she did not know
how much life would cost her, and indeed with her
vague ideas about money, she could not tell until
she had tried.  He had given her five hundred
dollars, and the arrangement was that she would
make that last as long as she could, and then write
for more.  Alas! it did not last very long.  By
the time travelling expenses were cleared, the
hotel bill paid for their week's stay in St. Helier
while they were seeking a house, Haidee's school
fees advanced, and the little farm stocked with
necessaries, there was not much of the five hundred
dollars in sight.</p>
<p class="pnext">Some of it, too, had been used in erecting houses
and runs for the hens and rabbits that were to
bring in a fortune!  Val, with the amateur's
delusion that after the initial expense all is profit,
rushed into the usual mistake of overstocking.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Every fowl is an asset," she told herself, and
bought fowls by the dozen, regardless of age, pedigree,
or laying qualifications, until pulled up at the
round turn by an article in the poultry journal on
the importance of good breeding stock.  Thereafter,
she and Haidee decided to keep all the early
purchases for "laying purposes only," and buy
a special pen of thoroughbreds for breeding
chickens.  Earnestly they studied the advertisement
columns of the poultry journal.  Prices for
breeding pens were high.</p>
<p class="pnext">"We can't afford to pay such sums, Haidee--but
there is the exchange column!  What about that?"</p>
<p class="pnext">The exchange column was rich in proposals from
philanthropists who apparently desired nothing
better than to stock the British Isles with the best
breeds of poultry at a dead loss to themselves.
Pens of five, seven, and nine fowls of the purest
pedigree were proffered for things patently not
half the value of the poultry.  Nothing but the
most profound altruism, for instance, could have
prompted the offer from an English rectory of
"A magnificent prize-pen of Black Langshans for
breeding purposes (four hens and a cock) in
exchange for clothing, provisions, or <em class="italics">anything
useful</em>."  If a sinister significance lurked in the
last sentence the Cliff Farm enthusiasts possessed
not the ungenerosity of soul to suspect it.
Portraits of Black Langshans in the poultry book
discovered them to be birds of a grace and elegance
astonishing and the text declared them splendid
layers of lovely pink eggs.</p>
<p class="pnext">The pink eggs decided the matter.  Val flew
to make out a list of all she would give in exchange.
Provisions they had none, but she possessed
clothes to spare in so good a cause.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p class="first pfirst">A Liberty ball gown of old-gold satin.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="pfirst">(2) A motor coat made by Paquin, with a great
hood of orange velvet.</p>
<p class="pnext">(3) A pair of bronze evening shoes, embroidered
with emerald butterflies.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="4">
<li><p class="first pfirst">A pair of old-paste buckles set in silver.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="pfirst">"It seems a shame to send them," said Haidee,
stroking the orange velvet hood, the dawn of
femininity in her eye.  "They 're so awfully nice.
I 'm sure they 're worth more than a pen of Langshans, Val."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Yes, I know," said Val, gazing at the ball
gown wistfully.  "But where could I sell them,
Haidee?  One can't go hawking clothes for sale
round Jersey.  And we <em class="italics">must</em> have the fowls and
we <em class="italics">must n't</em> spend Garry's money on experiments.
Besides it is better to get rid of things like these,
they only make one think of balls and motors and
frivolous things that don't matter a bit."</p>
<p class="pnext">Haidee looked at her curiously.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Just fancy <em class="italics">you</em> ever having gone to balls,
Val--and ridden in motors!  I would never have
believed it!  I can't think of you in anything else
but your big grey overall aprons."</p>
<p class="pnext">Val flushed painfully.  The grey overalls were
a concomitant feature of life in New York only,
but Haidee was not to know that.</p>
<p class="pnext">"At any rate we 'll send the things.  Now let
us see what we can dig out in exchange for this
pair of Belgian hares--they say they are the best
kind for increasing and marketing.  Oh, Haidee! perhaps
we shall be able to make quite a lot of money!"</p>
<p class="pnext">If they did not it would not be the fault of
either of them, for they threw themselves heart and
soul into the affairs of the farm.  Val fed the
fowls at early dawn, made hot mashes for them on
cold mornings, cleaned out nests perpetually,
ground up old china to make grit, and set broody
hens on several dozen eggs, so as to have chickens
ready for the spring markets.  There was nothing
she and Haidee disdained to do.</p>
<p class="pnext">On cold winter nights when Bran was asleep they
would sit curled over the fire calculating the
fortunes they were going to make out of their chickens
and computing the large sums that would presently
come rolling in when the breeding pen was
in full swing, the spring chickens hatched, and all
the hens laying simultaneously.  To make money
at poultry farming seemed as easy as rolling off a log.</p>
<p class="pnext">"It will be almost a shame to give it up," said
Val, with brooding eyes.  "A paying concern like
this!  When the time comes for us to go back to
America we shall have to instal some one to take
charge.  We may even some day be able to buy
the farm out of our profits, Haidee!  If we do, it
shall be yours and Bran's, because you work like
a little brick at it."</p>
<p class="pnext">"I shall then buy up Scone's field and go in for
Plymouth Rocks and Faverolles only," announced
Haidee.</p>
<p class="pnext">(Scone was their nearest neighbour, a farmer
whose land adjoined their own.)</p>
<p class="pnext">This was their method of calculation.</p>
<p class="pnext">"We have fifty hens now: six broody hens are
sitting on twelve eggs, and when they hatch out we
shall have seventy-two chickens; fifty of those we
will fatten and send to market at half-a-crown
each (that will bring us in six pounds).  The other
twenty-two we will keep for laying purposes next
year; added to the fifty hens we now have that
will make seventy-two hens laying eggs, which we
will sell for at least a shilling per dozen."</p>
<p class="pnext">It seemed a shame to take the people's money!</p>
<p class="pnext">The spell of hens was on them.  When at last
a few chickens of shamefully mongrel breed were
hatched out, they might have been offspring of
the dodo from the way the family crooned and
gloated over them, warming them at the fireside,
feeding them with wonderful concoctions, sitting
in the open yard for hours to watch their antics.
The ways of the elder hens also enchanted them,
and each of the fifty had a Christian name
bestowed by reason of some peculiar charm or
quality.  There were: Grey Lady, Eagle, Crooktail,
Favvy, Blind Eye, Johannesburg Moll, Flirt,
Long Tom, Felix, and The Lady with the Fan, etc.</p>
<p class="pnext">The rabbits too were spell-binders.  Two
respective litters were heartlessly gobbled and
mutilated by does driven off their mental reservation
by the sight of human beings fondling their
new-born offspring.  After the occurrence of these
horrible tragedies, a book on rabbit-rearing was
bought, and the knowledge acquired that rabbit
babies should not be touched or even looked at
until they creep from the hutch and show
themselves.  As a result of this information later
litters were successful, and during the winter there
were wonderful wet nights when dozens of tiny
rabbits were brought for the sake of warmth and
dryness into the kitchen, and the furry things with
their bright wild ways popped and gambolled to
the sheer delight of every one--until the morning
came with the business of cleaning up after the
circus!</p>
<p class="pnext">The first disappointment came with the arrival
of the prize-pen of Black Langshans.  Their
rectory home was in Hampshire, so the railway
journey had not been long, but the sea-voyage
appeared to have affected their health.  They
staggered forth from the battered poultry basket--four
old black hags of hens, bulky and bleary as
washerwomen, hoary of ear and scaly of leg,
followed by a tall slender cock more like a phantom
ostrich than a fancier's bird.  He had a wild, red
eye, and appeared to be suffering from a
mysterious affliction in the legs, which caused him to
fall fainting at every few steps he made.  Haidee
cheerfully dosed him with the peppercorns which
were left over from the time when the chickens
had pip.  But nothing could rouse him from his
Hamlet-like melancholy.</p>
<p class="pnext">The hens must have been at least five years old,
but happily, neither Val nor Haidee knew enough
about the outward signs and symbols of fowl age
to realise the trick that had been played upon
them.  Only, it dawned upon them slowly in the
long months to come that they need never expect
pink eggs from the grandmotherly old
washer-women with good appetites.  As for the young
cock who was to have been the ancestor of many
wonderful chickens for market and prize-pen, for
reasons of either ill-health or chivalry, he was
celibate from birth, and could never be beguiled
into taking any interest in his wives.  He spent
most of his life in having fainting fits, or fleeing
on staggering legs from younger and lustier birds.
At other times he dreamed on one leg, his
melancholy head plunged into his bosom.</p>
<div class="center transition">
<p class="pfirst">――――</p>
</div>
<p class="pfirst">Haidee got on well at school.  Far from being
troubled by lack of intelligence she was an
exceedingly clever girl; but she hated study, and much
preferred cleaning out rabbit-hutches or putting
fresh straw in the hens' nests.  Her passion was for
a pony.  There was a little governess-car in the
Stable-house, and permission with the tenants to
use it.  Only there was nothing to pull it.  But
three months after their arrival Haidee looked up
from a letter from Westenra, and announced the
receipt of twenty pounds for the purchase of a
pony.  Val stared.</p>
<p class="pnext">"You did n't ask for it, did you, Haidee?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Oh, no; I just mentioned that there was a cart,
and how nice it would be if there was a horse, and
how I would do all the looking after it myself, and
we need n't have to pay a man at all," said Haidee
airy and unblushing.</p>
<p class="pnext">Val did not reproach her, but she felt vexed that
Westenra should be asked to hand out money when
she, though hard-pressed, abstained to ask for
anything but the price of everyday necessities.
However, the pony was a great joy to Haidee, and
she had an excuse at last for the stable-boy airs she
loved to assume.  Nothing pleased her better than
to take off her skirts, and donning knickers and
long boots, clean out the stable.  She would
swagger and swing her shovel and shout "Gittap!"
and "Hey thar!" as though she had been brought
up in a farmyard.  Val's unconventional soul was
hard to shock, but even she sometimes wondered
what Westenra, who admired Vere-de-Vere repose
in a woman, would say if he could hear his adopted
child at her labour of love in Joy's stable.  A
compensating feature was that the girl was in superb
health, and fortunately, there were no prim people
at hand to be shocked.  Indeed, as far as society
was concerned Cliff Farm might have been situated
at the Antipodes.  No one came to call, and not a
soul in the island suspected that the well-known
writer, "Wanderfoot," was living peacefully
among them, feeding bran mashes to a pony and
setting broody hens.</p>
<p class="pnext">The only people who interested themselves in
the occupants of Cliff Farm were the louts from
the neighbouring farm, and their interest could
very well have been dispensed with.  When they
looked over the hedge, and found Haidee in long
boots and knickers, whistling as she cleaned out
the stable, they stood sniggering; and when Val
took pot shots with her rook rifle at the crows
that picked the buds from the fruit-trees, they
made it their business to find out if she had a gun
licence.  The genus lout is of much the same
kidney all the world over.  In Jersey the farmers
have a great objection to "gentlemen farmers,"
and as Val seemed to come under that heading,
they disliked her accordingly.  Little she recked
as long as they did not openly interfere.  But she
and Haidee were sometimes nervous in their lonely
house, and Val would often get up in the night
and fire a shot out the window, just to let stray
loafers know that they were not afraid.  Eventually
they got a couple of dogs, and were more at ease.</p>
<p class="pnext">Their nearest neighbour, Scone, was a gross-looking
man, with coarse ears and little pig-eyes;
yet apparently he had the best kind of heart
inside his ungainly body, for he was all good advice
and helpful words to the occupants of Cliff Farm.
He advised Val to keep a pig to eat her "waste,"
and incidentally volunteered to supply her with
one from a litter of his own.  Later he offered to
take her chickens and eggs to market on condition
that she bought her butter and milk from him.</p>
<p class="pnext">It was not until long afterwards that she
discovered what mean advantage had been taken of
her trusting belief in the inherent decency of man.
These farming people disliked her.  She was not
one of them, and that was enough to call forth all
their malice and ill-will.  Scone had charged double
what a pig would have cost at the market, and
jested with his cronies on the subject.  Also
through his kind ministrations she was paying a
penny more per quart for milk than any one in the
island and receiving twopence less per dozen for
her eggs.</p>
<p class="pnext">However, this knowledge came later.  For the
time Farmer Scone was all unction and good
advice, and Mrs. Scone came often to the house to
give Val the benefit of her knowledge of chickens.
She was a common little woman, with a mouth full
of decayed teeth, and a purple nose, but Val looked
upon her as a type, and she never disdained to
know types.  Besides, Mrs. Scone was an oracle
on chickens, or so she professed.  Certainly most
of her statements as to food, etc., were at variance
with the poultry journals, but she sounded very
practical and convincing, and Val had never had
experience of people who from sheer malice give
wrong advice, and was far from suspecting the
depths of meanness that can lie in an ignorant
mind.</p>
<p class="pnext">It was Mrs. Scone who advised her to rear
capons for the market.  Said she:</p>
<p class="pnext">"<em class="italics">That's</em> the thing to do with your cockerels.
I have no time to try it myself, but you are so
clever, Mrs. Westenra, and would be sure to make
it pay.  Turn your cockerels into capons.  It is
the most profitable business going."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Capons?" said Val, vague-eyed.  "I always
thought capons were fish, and that monks ate
them for Friday's dinner."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Oh, dear me, no, they are not fish, though
monks will eat them fast enough if they get the
chance--any one will, they 're delicious.  You 'll
get from seven shillings and sixpence to ten
shillings for them any day in the week," averred
Mrs. Scone, and proceeded to explain to the
open-mouthed Val and Haidee the process of caponising.</p>
<p class="pnext">"So simple.  Just cut a small slit above the
wing of each bird with a pair of special scissors
which you buy; then you hook up and remove the
two little glands that lie along the backbone, and
there you have your capon!--instead of a young
cockerel that is always tearing about the run
fighting and eating his head off without putting
on any fat."</p>
<p class="pnext">Val was deeply intrigued.  Cockerels had
become one of her problems.  More than half the
chickens upon which she had counted for spring
eggs had either succumbed to the pip, or never
hatched out at all; of the remainder the larger
proportion had turned out to be of male sex.
Rose-coloured dreams of getting into touch with the
Jesuit College on the hill above St. Helier and
doing a flourishing business with the monks now
floated through her mind.  But she shivered at
the thought of the caponising operation.  She was
physically incapable of cutting anything, even
the head off a dead fish.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Oh, I couldn't," she said, "at least I don't
think I could."</p>
<p class="pnext">"A pity!" said Mrs. Scone.  "There's a fortune
in it for them as will do it--a mint of money."</p>
<p class="pnext">This gave Val pause.  Had she, just because she
was a coward about cutting things, any right to
reject a scheme that had a mint of money in it?
Was it fair to Westenra?  After profound
consideration, and much guileful persuasion by
Haidee, always eager for experiments, she decided
to at least give the idea a fair trial.  So, on an
afternoon, twelve of the finest cockerels were
enthusiastically chased and captured by Haidee,
aided by one of Farmer Scone's farm boys kindly
lent for the occasion, and put under a rabbit-hutch
to await their fate.  A packing case constituted
the operating table and the instruments of torture
lay beside it--Val had sent for a little case from
London (price thirty shillings).  Mrs. Scone and
Haidee held the first bird on the table, and Val
under the direction of the former, with white face
and trembling lips, made the first slit.  The
cockerel at the prick of the instrument screamed like a
banshee, and Val's unnerved hand fell to her side.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Oh! how brutal it seems!" she faltered.</p>
<p class="pnext">On the urgent advice of the others she attempted
to finish the operation (with her eyes closed), but
the cockerel objected strenuously, blood flew in
every direction and heart-rending shrieks tore the
air.  White as ashes the operator let the scissors
fall and staggered to the door.  Mrs. Scone,
purring solicitously, supported her into the open air.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Dear me, dear me!  What a good heart you
have, to be sure, Mrs. Westenra!"</p>
<p class="pnext">Later, leaving Val sitting outside very sick, she
returned to the operating theatre, and she, and
Haidee and the farm hand between them
performed on the rest of the cockerels with such
vigour that three of them died the same night,
and two more a few days later; four, after a long
convalescence, recovered, but stayed languid and
appetiteless for the remainder of their existence;
while the rest, after a week or two recovering their
usual sprightly temperament, fought, pursued
each other, and ate up all the food as gaily as before.</p>
<p class="pnext">That was the end of the caponising business.
The great scheme for supplying fat capons to the
Jesuit College (not for Friday's dinner, of course,
but as an article of nourishment proper to
monasteries) never materialised.</p>
<div class="center transition">
<p class="pfirst">――――</p>
</div>
<p class="pfirst">Westenra in the meantime was writing grimly,
and not often.  From his letters Val gathered
something of the strain of life at No. 700 West 68.
The place was paying better now under Miss
Holland's management, but, as she had foreseen,
he hated to live in such close communion with
people who were nothing to him.  After the first
few weeks he had gone into bachelor quarters once
more, not his old ones in the city, but rooms near
the sanatorium.  Operations were coming in well,
but there were big gaps in his banking account
made by the fateful year of experiment.  A note
of weariness often crept into his letters--and when
he wrote:</p>
<p class="pnext">"So glad you are happy--<em class="italics">at last</em>--with your
fowls and rabbits.  Do not let them absorb you
altogether," it sounded to her very like a reproach.
Often he said, "I envy you--with the children
about you."  But for the most part he rejoiced
that the conditions of her life should be so ideal
for health and happiness.  Sometimes to Haidee
he would cry out boyishly:</p>
<p class="pnext">"How I would like to be with you and Bran in
the windy fields, running after the rabbits."</p>
<p class="pnext">Like every man whose boyhood has been spent
in the country, he loved fields, and rabbits, and
birds--all wood and hedge creatures; could
describe the eggs and whistle the note of every
bird in the British Isles.  Haidee wrote him long
accounts of the life at Cliff Farm, and when she
began to make a collection of eggs by very carefully
taking only one from a nest of four or five, if ever
she had any doubt on the subject of parentage
Westenra was never too busy to clear up the matter
by return mail.</p>
<p class="pnext">He was obliged to economise narrowly, and the
consciousness of this drove Val into a state of
frenzy if obliged to spend an unexpected sou.  But
never having been trained in economy she had not
the faintest notion of how to practise it, except
by doing without personal things herself.  No
gowns; no new hats; no clothes at all, for herself.
Yet somehow that did not make any difference to
the bills.  There was always the awful food
problem, and the boot problem, and the problem of how
to make hens lay without paying large grain bills,
and a dozen other incidental problems!</p>
<p class="pnext">Like a good many people, Val had supposed that
fowls fed themselves.  Her brain had pictured
them actively pursuing worms, and insects, and
wild seeds during the intervals of laying.  She
found instead that they were like children in the
matter of meals, always there on time.  At dawn
and eve, to say nothing of mid-day, she would find
them standing dolorously at the back door with
eyes cocked expectantly at whoever came out.
Only after a good meal did they go forth to
promenade, and then it was to lay their eggs in
some distant hedge where nobody could find them.</p>
<p class="pnext">When the grain bills began to come in she
realised that in the poultry business there was an
output, as well as an intake, and that all her small
profits were eaten up by the fowls.</p>

<p class="pfirst">As the months went by and the first exhaustion
of body and spirit in which she had left
New York passed, Val's imagination once more
woke up, and began to torment her nights,
undoing the good effect of days spent in healthy
occupation.  In the soft, kind climate of Jersey her
body must soon have regained all its old nervous
strength if the spirit had not begun once more to
chafe and wear its scabbard.  Had she been a
woman merely separated for a while from the man
she loved with the certain hope of swift reunion,
how happy she could have been in the thought of
his joy in finding Bran so lovely and sturdy, Haidee
strong and handsome, herself recovered!  If only
all had been well!  But all was not well, and the
realisation of this fact began to push serenity from
her mind, waking up old aches and hungers she
had believed long since extinguished--the longing
to pack a knapsack and depart for the horizon,
to bathe her soul in the Lethe of a distant sunset,
and arise renewed and free of the cares and
conventions of life.  Her feet tingled to travel.  The
sky-line began to pull at, and "play" her as if it
had a hook in her very vitals.  With every ship
that disappeared over the brim of the world went
some shade of her inmost being.  The song of
the rolling stone sang in her veins:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line">"I have a love for other lands,</div>
<div class="line">Which thro' my home life dogs my way.</div>

<div class="line">The love I have for other lands."</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
</div>
</div>

</blockquote>
<p class="pfirst">She got into the way of sitting on a rabbit-hutch
staring before her at the empty sea until she saw
it no longer, nor the sea-gulls that wheeled in
circles, but only the wide veldt empty of all but
a line of kops and a great berg to be passed on the
morrow--changing pictures round an out-spanned
waggon--oxen with heads bent, moving gradually
onwards, the tinkling of a cattle-bell, evening
fires lighted--Haidee and Bran bounding about
examining new flowers, strange insects, the spoor
of wild creatures--Westenra with a gun--problems
gone out of his eye, the rustle of dollars forgotten--just
a simple, primitive vagabond like herself.
Ah!  Vain day dreams!  Even while she dreamed
she could feel the wretched truth stirring at the
back of her mind, waiting like some horrible yellow
viper with head reared ready to strike.</p>
<p class="pnext">Sleep became rare with her.  However hard the
day's work, she never had more than an hour or
two of the dead slumber of exhaustion.  Then,
regular as an alarm, a little worry-bell would
ring in her brain, dimly at first, then more and
more insistent and clamorous.  At last she would
be as widely awake as if some one had taken her
by the shoulders and shaken her out of sleep to hear
some terrible and significant news.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Wake up, Val Valdana, you have slept long
enough!  There is the little affair of Garrett
Westenra's happiness to consider--and Garrett
Westenra's son--and Horace Valdana's lease of
life!  There are several other affairs also, which
in the daytime you are apt to consider of minor
importance, but which you can see clearly in these
small still hours are very important and pressing
indeed--the affair of that grain bill for which you
have not the ready money!--those new shoes
Haidee requires!--the young cockerels eating off
their heads--and how are you going to raise more
money for Valdana?"</p>
<p class="pnext">Ah! that yellow viper that sits in the human
heart and haunts the human brain, crying <em class="italics">yes</em>
when we cry <em class="italics">no</em>, and <em class="italics">pleasure</em> when we cry <em class="italics">duty</em>,
and <em class="italics">duty</em> when we cry <em class="italics">pleasure</em>, and <em class="italics">wake</em> when we
cry <em class="italics">sleep</em>--Val lay with it through the hours of
many a weary night!</p>
<p class="pnext">Only once had definite news come to her of
Valdana, and that was about two months after
she had settled in Jersey: a letter from his mother
in answer to one Val had written telling of the
<em class="italics">rencontre</em> in New York came through the medium
of Val's agent in London.  Old Mrs. Valdana's
letter was dismal in tone and matter.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Yes, Horace is indeed with us still, but not for
long.  Can you not be kind to him, Val?" was
the cry from her mother-heart; but the same
instinct in Val hardened her to the cry.  She, too,
was a mother, and in most women the mother-love
comes before wife-love and friend-love, and
even lover-love.  Nature thus decrees it, that
life may go unfalteringly on.  So Val could not be
kind to Valdana because it meant being hurtful
to her son.  Besides, what was the kindness asked?
Of any affection for her he was utterly devoid, he
desired nothing but money, which she did not
possess.  Her jewels were exhausted save a few
rings, beautiful in colour and form, but of no great
value, and her "comfort necklace," which she
now wore continually under her dress.  The best
she could do was to write asking Branker Preston
to take her furniture and possessions out of storage
and put them up to auction.  But she directed
him to first ask her great friend, Harriott Kesteven
to go through all trunks and drawers on a
destructive expedition, burning all old letters,
photographs, etc.  Mrs. Kesteven complied with this
request but not literally.  Instead of burning them
she had all papers and photographs, together with
many personal things, precious though not
intrinsic, packed up and sent to Val.  There were
sketches of places she had visited, a few ivories,
books, draperies, curios, and some specially
charming Japanese chintzes.  When Val opened
packages, her eyes darkened with tears.  It seemed
so long since she had lived with these things about
her, and a heart comparatively care-free.  A
moment later she caught Bran to her breast.</p>
<p class="pnext">"You are worth it all.  You are my ivory, my
roses, my fine gold, the best article I ever wrote.
I have made my travels and my troubles into a
vase of living porphyry."</p>
<p class="pnext">Haidee took the things and arranged them about
the farm sitting-room, transforming it.  But Val
could not rest until she had sat down and
written to Westenra, telling him how the thing had
occurred.</p>
<div class="center transition">
<p class="pfirst">――――</p>
</div>
<p class="pfirst">When, as the summer crept on, Westenra in his
letters began to make tentative remarks about his
coming vacation, Val's yellow viper was roused
to high effort.</p>
<p class="pnext">There are certain dark days on the calendar of
every life; days when everything goes wrong,
when things are lost and broken, mistaken words
said, fatal promises made.  One such day dawned
for Val.  She arose haggard from a sleepless
night to attend to her household duties.  It was
a servantless interval, and there was the fire to
make and breakfast to prepare.  After waking
Haidee, she put on an old dressing-gown, more
notable for its warm lining than for its youth and
beauty, and hurried down-stairs to feed the fowls
who, "carking" bitterly at the back-door, were
liable to wake Bran before his time.  It affronted
her furiously to open the door upon Farmer Scone
and one of his labourers passing down her yard.
He knew that it annoyed her to have him make this
short cut across her grounds to reach one of his
pasture fields, but he had done it repeatedly since
she discovered his dishonesty in the marketing of
her eggs, and discontinued dealing with him.  If
there had been a man at Cliff Farm he would never
have dreamed of thus invading private property.
But Val being alone he felt safe, and his mean
nature rejoiced in taking advantage of a woman,
whom he had discovered did not like to be rude to
any one.</p>
<p class="pnext">On this particular morning, however, neighbourly
courtesy could no longer keep down just
wrath.  What infuriated Val was that she should
be seen in her disreputable old gown.  It always
seemed like an affront put upon Garrett if she
allowed any one to see her looking unkempt and
untidy.  A still greater offence was that these
common oafs, who saw and judged only surface things,
should so discover her.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Good marning!" said Farmer Scone, affably
familiar, but without raising his hand to his cap.
The dislike and contempt she had long felt for the
man rose in Val like a wave, and would no longer
be contained.  She drew herself up and, looking
at him, as a queen might look at an insolent groom,
said cuttingly:</p>
<p class="pnext">"Please understand, Scone, that I do not care
to have my yard used as a pathway.  You must
in the future go round by the road."</p>
<p class="pnext">Scone's little pig-eyes regarded her with venom,
then he laughed impudently.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Great Galumps!"  Not quick-witted, he was
obliged to grope in the depths of his mind for a
moment or two to see what he could produce to
hurt the pale, proud woman, who looked at him
as if he were less than dust.  The best he could
drag up from those dim depths was a sneer at her
looks--she looked old that morning, poor Val,
after her vigil with the <em class="italics">serpent jaune</em>, and there are
some mean natures that love to taunt a woman
with age.  He turned to his labourer.</p>
<p class="pnext">"By Jarge, Tom!  The old woman got out of
her bed wrong side this marning," said he, and the
two burst into senseless guffaws, and marched on
down the path.  A further delicate witticism
connecting the "old woman's" temper with the
absence of "an old man" added to a grossly-expressed
doubt as to whether she owned an "old
man" at all, came back across the field.  Val heard
it and turned white.</p>
<p class="pnext">"This is what I have come to!" she cried to
herself in wrath and unhappiness.  "A lonely,
wretched woman whom pigs may insult! the
victim of every base-tongued wretch----!"</p>
<p class="pnext">She turned back into the house, and sat down
in utter dejection by the kitchen table.</p>
<p class="pnext">"They insult me because they see I have no
husband to protect me," she mused bitterly.  "I
who have two!"</p>
<p class="pnext">The sound of Bran crowing his little morning
crow up-stairs helped her to recover, and she made
the fire and put the kettle on for breakfast.  A
few moments later the postwoman knocked at the
door, and handed in two letters.  By the delicate
irony of the god of black days the letters were from
her two husbands!  She sat down and began to laugh.</p>
<p class="pnext">Far from being lonely and undesirable she was,
it seemed, highly desired by each.  Westenra's
letter was somewhat cold, it is true, but the burden
of it was quite clear: he intended sailing from New
York within six weeks, and wished her to make
preparations to return with him.</p>
<p class="pnext">Valdana, writing from Berlin, via his mother and
Val's agent, sent news that was plainly meant to
be inspiriting.  After a consultation held on his
case by German specialists he was able to announce
that his complaint was not cancer at all, but merely
liver trouble induced by the South African climate,
and over-exertion (the last was his own invention
and took the place of the words "alcoholic excess"
in the doctors' diagnosis).  Moreover the specialists
had given him every hope of a long life if
he would set out for a country with a bracing
climate, and he cheerfully handed on the hope to
Val, as though it were some golden gift.  The
ultimate burden of his letter came to much the
same thing as Westenra's.  He wanted her with
him.  His mother was prepared to make a special
sacrifice of certain securities to give him a fresh
start in Canada.  Would Val give him a fresh start
too, and come with him?</p>
<p class="pnext">And this was the woman whom pigs insulted
because she had no husband to protect her!  She
laughed convulsively, as one might laugh who felt
the first twinge of the rack, and when she had
finished laughing she sat on reading and dully
re-reading, her hands pressed to her temples.
Suddenly a vibrating spasm of agony shot through her
teeth and flew up like veins of red-hot fluid into
her cheeks and eyes.  Neuralgia, that torment of
the troubled, had for weeks been lurking behind
its friend and ally the yellow viper, and now chose
this propitious moment to lay its scorpion claws
upon her.  All that day, and for many days after,
she almost forgot the terrible problem of her
marriage in the agony of her nerves.</p>
<div class="center transition">
<p class="pfirst">――――</p>
</div>
<p class="pfirst">Val had never professed a religion or belonged to
any faith.  She had just been taught to say her
prayers and put her trust in God; no forms; no
church.  She supposed she must have been
baptised as a child, but could not be sure.  Her
mother was a Catholic who loved the smell of
incense, but never went to confession.</p>
<p class="pnext">Thus she had grown up with an open mind for
all faiths and no faith of her own.  Yet, though
she was not pious, religion had always attracted
her, and sometimes at rare moments she had seen
the vision of a Light beyond the world.  At other
times all forms of religion she knew of seemed a
mere wearisome routine of duty and custom.
But when in New York she had come into touch
with practised Catholicism she felt the strong
appeal of its Eternal beauty and the power of that
wonderful faith to direct and hold emotional
impulsive natures like her own from casting the soul
after the heart.  And she recognised at once that
it was the only religion for her and for any child of
hers who inherited her nature.  So, at odd
intervals in the rush and tear of the early days at
No. 700 she had been preparing herself for baptism
by trying to get a hold with her mind on the
dogmas for which she cared nothing, but of which a
knowledge is essential to any one wishing to enter
the Catholic Church.</p>
<p class="pnext">When her child was born there was an altar in
her room with flowers on it and a <em class="italics">veilleuse</em> burning
before the Sacred Heart, for it was the month of
June.  When Bran was baptised she desired greatly
to enter the church with him, but her instruction
was not complete, and her reception had been put
off from day to day.  Then came Westenra's
sickness and Valdana's resurrection, putting an
end to all thoughts of the kind.  She had
something to hide, and those who have such things to
hide cannot enter the Catholic Church.  Westenra
supposed she had changed her mind, and thought
none the better of her for it.</p>
<p class="pnext">As a matter of fact she had at that juncture felt
more need than ever for the help of religion in her
life.  She longed for the advice of grave good men.</p>
<p class="pnext">And now again she felt that longing.  Her own
<em class="italics">will</em> to do right did not seem enough; and indeed
reflect and analyse as she would she could not
decide what was the right thing to do.  What was
it?  Her sick brain put the question over and
over again.  Was it right to go back to Valdana?
If so, <em class="italics">why</em> was it right when her heart and soul and
every instinct in her fought against such a verdict?
It could not be right to return.  Valdana deserved
nothing of her, had deserted her and her child, had
done without her for years, had exploited her for
the money she made, was a coward and a brute
with whom association could only bring degradation.
To go back to him would be to desert her
child, for she could never let Bran come within his
radius.</p>
<p class="pnext">Ought she then to desert her child--her contribution
to the world, her link in the golden chain of
generations, her one word in the great eternal Sonnet?</p>
<p class="pnext">Never!  Though Westenra might be a devoted
father Bran would never, without a mother, grow
up to be the man she hoped.  No little child can
spare its mother,--though many, alas! by the hard
decree of death, and oftener the cruel decisions of
life, have to do so.  There is something a mother
gives a child which no one else in the whole wide
world can give.  Val had a curious belief too that
just as no woman possessed a soul except through
the man she loved and the child she passed on, so
no son ever came to the full possession of his soul
except through the love of a mother.  From what
strange fields of mental and physical suffering she
had garnered those beliefs it would be difficult to
determine, but they sat fast in her heart and she
lived and breathed by them.  Emerson seemed to
her to share something of the belief when he wrote:
"In my dealing with my child my Latin and Greek
accomplishments and my money stand me nothing;
but as much as I have of soul avails."</p>
<p class="pnext">Apart from that she was sure that no boy ever
yet came to the physical perfection his babyhood
promised without a mother to brood and guard
over his growing years.  Who else but a mother
will compute the effect of an extra blanket on a
little sweating body, or the lack of one in winter?
Will study the heart and mind and nerves and
stomach of a child all through that period when
each year of full content and harmony and health
assures five years of strength and well-being later on?</p>
<p class="pnext">Never, never could she leave Bran.  Ought she
then to tell Westenra?  What a relief it would be
to share the dreadful truth, have his support to
face it.  Half the terror of the situation was in the
attitude she was obliged to assume towards him.
Yet a kind of mother-love for him too--that
crooning, protective mother-love that every
woman feels for a beloved man cried out against this
solution.  She did not want him to suffer.  She
did not want to wound and shame him as he would
be wounded and shamed if he found himself not
married to her, and his son illegitimate.  She
longed to save him from that pain.  But now she
saw plainly that if Valdana were recovering
Westenra would have to know.  He could not
be kept for ever in the dark, suffering through her
enigmatic coldness.  Ah!  What misery was
before them all; for Garrett wifeless and childless;
for Bran fatherless; for herself lonely and
separated from the man she loved.</p>
<p class="pnext">For Valdana she felt no pity, for she knew that
if he suffered it would be only through his external
senses, never through his heart.  There was no
susceptivity, in that callous heart for any but
himself.</p>
<p class="pnext">It came into her head once or twice that she
would throw morality to the winds, conceal the
truth from Westenra for ever, or at least until she
was found out, and returning to America get all
the joy she could out of life with him and her son.
How desirable <em class="italics">now</em> looked the vision of life at
700 West 68!---beautiful as some far coral island
with waving palms and blue lagoons to the eyes
of a drowning sailor!  Yes, almost she could make
her mind up to do this thing; to accept the remote
chance of being found out, to embrace love and
life with both arms; to "take the Cash and let
the Credit go."</p>
<p class="pnext">But--<em class="italics">she could not</em>.  Morality sprang up where
she denied it.  Not the morality of family
training nor church teaching, but of years of instinctive
choice between right and wrong, and attention to
that still, small voice whose judgment is so
unfailingly sure.  It had nothing to do with convention,
this decision.  She had no sense at all of the power
of infallibility of social laws.  It was just the law
of the soul that forbade it.  Even had she not
possessed this morality of the soul, there was one
other thing that would have held her back.  Ever
since Bran came to her she had hugged to her heart
a little phrase that cut into her while she pressed
it there.</p>
<p class="pnext">"No man can be truly great who had not a
great mother."</p>
<p class="pnext">And great mothers are made by great sacrifice.
Not that she aspired to be anything within a
hundred miles of greatness.  How unlucky Bran
had been in his choice of a mother only she,
conscious of her defects and failings, could know.
But from the first she had sworn to give him every
chance that sacrifice of herself could bestow.
And here was the time for her to make good the
resolution.</p>

<div class="vspace" style="height: 2em">
</div>
<p class="pfirst">These decisions did not prevent her from
spending days and nights in an agony of
mental and physical pain.  Neuralgia racked her
until she thought she must go mad.  She became
weak and haggard from want of sleep.  A longing
for veronal seized her.  Only, she was afraid of
veronal.  In the past it had got a hold on her that
nothing but Westenra's influence could have
broken, and vaguely she knew that one cannot
break twice from the same enemy.  Westenra's
power might not be so overwhelming next time,
the hold of the drug would be stronger.  Veronal,
then, was forbidden; but she had no such feeling
about alcohol.  She had given up drinking spirits
and wine, not because it had any temptation for
her, but because Westenra hated women to drink.
She was not afraid of the power of brandy over her.
And so one day, in a delirium of pain and misery,
she sent out the little servant for a bottle of
brandy.</p>
<p class="pnext">Ah! what rapturous repose for a few hours!
... what glorious oblivion from pain
... what a lifting of leaden clouds and rose-tinting
of the horizon with hope!  When she felt the
effect of a strong dose of brandy going off and
the scorpion claws beginning to tear at her eyes
and temples once more she took another dose.
As soon as one bottle of brandy was finished she
sent for another.  For weeks she forgot in this
way both mental and physical trouble, drowning
her pain by day and sleeping heavily by night.
Then one morning in a blinding flash she realised
what she was doing.  Going into the pantry she
saw four empty bottles standing there.  She had
seen them before, but now she <em class="italics">recognised</em> them,
and it was she who in one week had emptied them!</p>
<p class="pnext">"I am taking to drink!" she cried, and the
phrase heard so often in jest amongst journalists
took unto itself a new and awful significance that
made her recoil horror-stricken before the damning
evidence.  Two full bottles stood by the empty
ones.  She had blindly ordered several bottles
at once in a panic of fear that pain might come
upon her sometime and find her unprepared.
Even now the thirsty beast in her was raising its
head and crying out for what was at once tonic
and narcotic.  And she was at one with the beast
in its desire.  She wanted the brandy, madly
desired it for its own sake, longed to feel it warm in
her body sending up a glow of comfort and
well-being, soothing her pains with velvety hands,
dimming her vision of the truth with rosy-pink
veils of hope, filling her heart with the careless
philosophy of the drinker--that everything turns
out well in the end, and "all is for the best in the
best of all possible worlds."  Away with dull
care and pain!  Her hand was already on the
bottle, when in her mind, like a little bright sword
with which to fight an enemy, a thought beautifully
clothed in words presented itself:</p>
<p class="pnext">"No man can be great who has not a great mother."</p>
<p class="pnext">It is such phrases as these that help make the
world's history.  It is thus that beautiful thoughts
which have been treasured and loved reward and
befriend in times of stress.  Val killed her desire
for drink with the weapon a writer had forged for
her many years before, and that she herself had
brightened ready for use.</p>
<p class="pnext">In a moment she had gathered up all the bottles,
empty and full, thrust them into a bag, and was
carrying them out of the house.  There was no one
about.  Haidee was at school; the little maid had
carried Bran down the fields.  She hurried with
her burden to a deep dell that lay in the farm
grounds--a dell with trees growing round it, and
grassy slopes full of primroses and early violets.
At the bottom grew a mass of nettles and long
rank grass, and into this she flung the bottles in
a heap, and hurried away from the sound of the
liquid bubbling over the broken glass and the
strong spirity scent that rose amongst the weeds.</p>
<p class="pnext">That was over; a leaf turned; a battle won!</p>
<p class="pnext">Some terrible days came later.  No vice puts in
its insidious roots more deeply than the drink vice,
or more strongly resents being torn from its chosen
place.  It clings and burns and aches, leaving
scars, as ivy leaves scars on the tree from which it
is dragged away.  But it was no old deep-seated
vice with Val, and victory was to her, though when
the battle was over she looked less like victory
than defeat.  In the end she determined to see a
doctor in St. Helier and get a tonic that would pull
her together before Westenra came home--an
event that might occur any time within the next
six weeks.</p>
<p class="pnext">One afternoon, then, on a day that Haidee had
a holiday and could keep an eye on Bran and the
little maid, Val walked down to the station and
took a train for town.  The way was long, and she
in no great trim for walking.  Added to this
unusual effort was a train journey and a weary
hunt for the house of the doctor whose address
she had forgotten to bring with her.  All these
things were responsible for the exhaustion which
caused her, after the doctor had examined and
prescribed for her, to faint quietly in her chair.
When she regained consciousness she was lying
down in a shaded room, with the burning taste of
brandy in her mouth and the odour of it all about
her--they had spilt it on her gown whilst forcing
it between her lips.</p>
<p class="pnext">"What is it?  Where am I?" she cried.</p>
<p class="pnext">"All right; there's nothing very wrong
... you are only a little run down," the doctor soothed
her, and the doctor's wife, standing by with
sympathetic eyes, said gently: "You must rest a little
while, and then have a cab to go home.  You are
thoroughly overtired."</p>
<p class="pnext">They insisted on her taking a cab, but she
dismissed it at the station, and, after the railway
journey, once more made the long walk across
the fields.  When she reached home at last, very
faint and weary, the night had fallen, but the little
house lighted up, and as she came up the path
she could hear Haidee's laugh ringing out, and
Bran's merry crow.  How happy they were, bless them!</p>
<p class="pnext">As she reached the door something new and
unaccustomed came out to meet her, some subtle
difference in the atmosphere, the tone of the
children's voices, and in a flash she knew the truth.
Westenra had arrived during her absence!</p>
<p class="pnext">He was sitting in the big double easy-chair, with
Haidee squeezed beside him and Bran in his arms.
The room was full of a kind of warm happiness.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Oh, Joe!" she cried, and running forward,
forgot Valdana, forgot everything but her joy in
seeing him again, threw herself upon the little
group and kissed them all alternately, wildly, like
a mad creature.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Yes, here I am," said Westenra, laughing,
and the moment she heard his voice she knew
there was something wrong.  She had no idea of
the strong odour of brandy she had brought into
the little room with her, and she did not know until
later what had happened during the afternoon.
She only realised, with her quick and sure intuition,
that Westenra was even more estranged from her
than when they had parted in New York.  There
was a distance in his manner for which his last
letter had hardly prepared her.</p>
<p class="pnext">After the ice-cold misery of the first few moments
she was dully thankful for his attitude.  It was
for the best.  If he had ceased to care for her, so
much the better for him: so much the less pain to
be suffered in separation.  She sat down and
began to talk mechanically, eliciting details of
his journey.  It appeared he had arrived in the
Island that morning.  The steamer docked very
late on account of fog.  He had just missed a train,
and had been obliged to wait for an hour at the
station, and then it had taken him a considerable
time to find the farm.  He had lost his way and
come round by an old unused route, which
accounted for the fact of his missing Val, for he had
arrived only a few moments after her departure.
Haidee had shown him everything.  They had
been over the poultry houses, fed the rabbits,
ridden the pony, and let the dogs loose to hunt
the rats----</p>
<p class="pnext">At this juncture of the narrative Haidee turned
red, and gave a swift embarrassed glance at
Westenra.  He, however, stared steadily before
him, a peculiar steely quality in his stare.  Val
saw Haidee's glance, and his strange look, but
knew the meaning of neither, and was too unhappy
to speculate on the subject.</p>
<p class="pnext">"He 's had a tub, and I 've fixed up his things
in the spare room," said Haidee presently.</p>
<p class="pnext">"You seem to have got along very well without
me," was all Val could say, with a pale smile.  "I
suppose I had better see about dinner now."</p>
<p class="pnext">A strange evening was passed.  Westenra could
not conceal his joy at being with the children once
more, but if he felt any at seeing Val he concealed
it well under a gay cold manner.  She on her side
felt all her happiness swallowed up in dismay.
Love was frozen in her heart.</p>
<p class="pnext">After supper Bran was bathed before the
bedroom fire and put to bed.  He had to be admired
first, and parade naked across the hearth-rug to
show all his little muscles.  He was able to walk
well now, and was as perfect as only baby children
can be before all their soft puppy-dog roundness
turns to length.  His parents devoured him with
their eyes, forgetting their miserable problems for
awhile in the joy of so beautiful a possession.</p>
<p class="pnext">"I tell you this fellow is out to make new figures
at the Olympics," said Westenra, who had all an
Irishman's madness for athletics.  "This is a
champion!"</p>
<p class="pnext">At last the children were in bed, the house
silent.  Garry and Val sat alone by the sitting-room
fire, constrained and far apart.</p>
<p class="pnext">"They look blooming," he said.  "This place
suits them better than New York apparently."</p>
<p class="pnext">(Ah! in his joy at seeing the children blooming
he had not noticed her haggard face!  Symptoms
that in others would have aroused his professional
interest in her went unnoticed, or so it seemed.
She remembered that she had once heard a doctor's
wife quote rather bitterly:</p>
<p class="pnext">"Shoemakers' children have broken boots;
doctors' wives never get treatment.")</p>
<p class="pnext">"Then you will not mind our going on living
here, Joe--for awhile?" she said a little wearily.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Do you wish it?"  She did not answer at once.
He looked at her gravely with something pitiful
in his glance.</p>
<p class="pnext">"The children are in great trim ... but you?  I
don't think it is any good to you to live like this."</p>
<p class="pnext">(He <em class="italics">had</em> noticed, then!  It had not escaped his
keen eye that she was grown old and lined!
Should she tell him about her neuralgia and the
terrible time she had gone through with her nerves?
But how sick he must be of women with nerves....
New York was full of them .... he had
just come on holiday--better wait!)</p>
<p class="pnext">"Oh, I am all right, Garrett," she said hastily.
"A little neuralgic at times----"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Ah!"</p>
<p class="pnext">"But it is nothing ... nothing."</p>
<p class="pnext">"I don't think you should go on living here.  The
idea was for you to get strong ... instead you
have--" he hesitated, and looked at her gravely
with indictment in his glance--"given way to
nerves."</p>
<p class="pnext">She glanced at him guiltily.  It almost seemed
to her that he had been going to say "given way
to drink!"  That he knew something of her struggle
with the brandy--yet how could he?</p>
<p class="pnext">"Oh, <em class="italics">nerves</em>!" she said, and laughed nervously.</p>
<p class="pnext">"I think the only thing to be done," he continued
steadily, "is for you to come back with me
to New York."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Oh, Garrett! ... I don't think....  I
can't do that," she stammered desperately.</p>
<p class="pnext">"You mean you don't want to?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"It is not a matter of wanting."</p>
<p class="pnext">He stood up then, stern-faced.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Don't beat about the bush.  This thing has
got to be settled once and for all.  Will or will you
not?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"I can't, Joe."  She looked at him with haunted
eyes.</p>
<p class="pnext">"You can't break loose?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Break loose?  What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Never mind ... never mind ... poor
Val!"  Sternness had gone from him.  "Well,
that is settled, then--I go back without you."  He
got up heavily and turned away from the fire.</p>
<p class="pnext">"I 'm dead-beat and must get rest, Val.  Haidee
has fixed me up very well in her nice little room;
she told me you always meant me to have it."</p>
<p class="pnext">He turned and looked at her, in his eyes a
sudden bitterness and anger born of his longing to
take into his arms and crush to him this woman
who exiled him from her heart.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Do you think it is quite fair, Val?  Do you
think you are playing the game?"</p>
<p class="pnext">She looked at him with wistful, harried eyes.</p>
<p class="pnext">"I am trying to, Joe--I----"</p>
<p class="pnext">What could she say?  Was this the moment to
stab him with the truth?  While she hesitated
wretchedly, he turned away again, walking round
the room, looking fiercely at the pictures and
chintzes he knew had belonged to her past life.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Haidee is growing into a nice girl," he said
abruptly, switching his mind from a subject that
maddened him.</p>
<p class="pnext">Val, by the fire struggling with her misery and
half-formed resolution, looked at him vaguely for
a moment.  Ah! he was speaking of Haidee--while
she was torturing herself with the thought that
he wanted her as she wanted him!</p>
<p class="pnext">"Good-night!" he said harshly, and went his
way up-stairs, without attempting to kiss her.  She
crouched down by the dying fire, and covered her
face with her hands.  Her heart was in great pain:
the great pain of a little child.  Footsteps overhead
told her that he went first to her bedroom to take
a last glimpse of Bran, and low murmurs betrayed
the fact that Haidee was not yet asleep.  At last
his light, firm tread crossed the floor once more,
then came the sound of his closing door.</p>
<p class="pnext">Another hour must have passed when Val, still
sitting by the fire, was startled to hear the patter
of feet on the bare oak stairs, then to find a slim
night-gowned figure beside her.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Haidee!"</p>
<p class="pnext">"I wanted to tell you something, Val, and was
afraid I 'd be asleep before you came up."</p>
<p class="pnext">"What is it?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Garry found all your empty brandy bottles
in the dell; we were hunting the rats there with
Billy and King."  Her big brown eyes rested
commiseratingly on Val.  It was evident she felt
guilty for having led Westenra to the dell, her very
look of guilt had in it something damning to the
poor pale culprit sitting there with a sick heart, no
trace on her of the victory she had achieved two
weeks ago.  She had believed her sin as secret as
her victory over it.  Yet here it rose up against
her in Haidee's eyes.  The child knew nothing of
the victory--only of the vice, though Val had
never felt herself observed.  And now Garry knew!
That was the reason then of their embarrassed
looks and averted eyes!</p>
<p class="pnext">"Of course he didn't say anything.  He
pretended he did n't notice even.  But you should
have seen his face."  She gazed dismally at Val.
It was as though they had offended God.  "And
you smelt awfully of brandy when you came
in--you do still."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Go to bed, Haidee," said Val at last, sick with
humiliation.  She had meant to tell of the brandy
episode some day, in some dear moment when all
was clear between them once more.  Now, through
being accidentally betrayed, the incident had
assumed a horrible aspect.  She was afraid to
think of what his thoughts on the subject must be.
She longed to tell him all.  To run up-stairs and
cry at his door: "I didn't drink it all, Garry;
two of the bottles were full when I threw them
away."  How silly and puerile that would sound.
He would, perhaps, see nothing in her action but
the terror of a confirmed drinker found out, might
imagine that he had married a secret drunkard!
She sat twisting her hands in an agony of misery.
How could she tell him?  What was the good?
How dared she even kiss him as she had done when
she came in?  Valdana was alive--she was not
even Joe's wife--what to do--what to do? ...
How brutal life was!</p>
<p class="pnext">Suddenly she fell to communing with her
dead--those who had loved and believed in her and knew
that however much she had failed in the heavy
trials and afflictions of the last year, at least she
had not been actuated by meanness or mere
self-indulgence.  <em class="italics">They</em> knew her as she used to
be--fearless and sure of her actions--before love
had laid bonds on her spirit, and sorrow and failure
crushed her down.  They understood, and would
not altogether condemn.  At last, curiously
strengthened, she rose and went up-stairs, the
firm purpose in her heart of going to Westenra to
tell him everything.</p>
<p class="pnext">She paused for a moment at his door--doubtless
he was sleeping, dead-beat as he said.  But that
could not be helped.  It was more important
even than his sleep that all should be put right
between them.  She owed it to herself as well as
to him.  Softly she turned the handle of the door,
but it did not open to her touch.  Westenra had
guarded himself against invasion.  It was locked.</p>
<div class="center transition">
<p class="pfirst">――――</p>
</div>
<p class="pfirst">At breakfast the next morning he announced
that he was due in London in two days' time to
deliver some lectures at one of the hospitals.
After that he must make a visit to Ireland on a
matter concerning some family property.  He
added vaguely that he should probably come back
again to Jersey before very long, but Val took that
for what it was--a bone thrown to Haidee, whose
face had visibly lengthened and darkened on
hearing this horrible news.  Bran, smiling in his
mother's arms, looked on affably--his father's
comings and goings meant little to him as yet, so
long as he had Val's soft cheek to rub his own
against.  She was very pale, but extraordinarily
composed, and made no comment on his plans.
She had withdrawn herself into some remote and
distant land of her own--a land where no birds
sang, nor flowers grew!  After breakfast she left
the others, and went about her household duties.
A conference in the garden between Westenra and
Haidee resulted in a resolution to walk down to
St. Aubin's and hire bicycles for a day's outing.
Haidee was strong as a Basuto pony, and Westenra
loved nothing better than to be out in the open air.
The bicycling is hilly in Jersey, and the two came
home tired out in the evening.  Haidee announced
that they had done their side of the Island from
Corbières to Plemmont Caves, and intended next
day to visit Bouley Bay, Archirondelle, and the
famous breakwater that cost half a million pounds
and is of no more use than a load of rotten hay.</p>
<p class="pnext">After the usual bath parade, at which Bran
presided, Val once more had the fireside and her
thoughts to herself.  Haidee and Westenra, tired
out, were glad to seek their beds.</p>
<p class="pnext">The next day they started early.  While Val
was cutting sandwiches for them, Westenra half
suggested that she should come too; but she smiled
quite naturally, and said that even if there were
any one to stay with Bran, it was so long since
she had cycled she would only be a drag to them.
"But I hope you will not be so tired to-night,
Garrett," she finished quietly.  "I want to have
a little talk with you after dinner."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Very well," he answered, looking at her
curiously.  He could not pretend to begin to
understand her, or what she meant or wanted.  He only
knew that he, too, had something to say before he
left Jersey the next day.  Though outwardly he
was composed, and in the company of Haidee even
gay, affecting great interest in their excursions,
his heart was heavy as a stone in him, and he was
brooding over his wrongs as only an Irishman can.
As it happened, rain began to fall heavily after
lunch, and somewhat early in the afternoon the two
cyclists returned wet and cross.  Westenra bathed,
and immediately began to pack his things for
departure by the next morning's boat.  The rest
of the afternoon was spent with the children.</p>
<p class="pnext">The sky had cleared by evening, and when after
dinner Val and Westenra walked across the fields
towards the cliff in the pale, clear, evening light,
they could see the tide furling and unfurling its
filmy laces of froth on St. Brelade's beach.</p>
<p class="pnext">Though she had come out with a set purpose she
found it hard to begin what she had to say.  For
all her remote manner and outward calm, her
heart, throbbing full, bounded in her breast and
beat in her throat until she felt suffocating.  It
was Westenra who spoke at last very gently, but
with something of a requiem note in his words.</p>
<p class="pnext">"So you see our love was not strong enough
after all to weather the storms, Val!"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Mine was ... mine is," her heart cried
out, but she looked at him dully.  She knew the
futility of such words now.  It was his own dead
love he was keening, not hers.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Our ship of dreams has gone to pieces."</p>
<p class="pnext">"No," burst from her lips almost against her will.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Yes, Val," his gentle tone became stern.
"Face the facts."</p>
<p class="pnext">They had seated themselves on some rocks near
the edge of the cliff.  Nothing broke the peace
of the evening but the swirr and swish of the gentle
tide on the beach below.</p>
<p class="pnext">"You promised to burn your boats ... never
to go back to old habits and possessions ... I
find you with your old possessions about you----"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Those pictures and chintzes?  I wrote and told
you how they came," she interrupted.  "They
can be burnt for all they are to me."</p>
<p class="pnext">He moved his hand with a desperate gesture.</p>
<p class="pnext">"That is nothing to the other.  Can you deny
that you have returned to one at least of your old
habits?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Oh!" she cried, and sat up like one who has
been struck.  But his heart was full of fury,
outraged hopes, and disappointment.  He could not
measure his words because she cried out.</p>
<p class="pnext">"It was not your boats you burned, but my
ship--my ship of dreams!"</p>
<p class="pnext">He went further, he accused her of breaking his
shrine, of succumbing to a vice that he detested
and despised with all his soul.  He said she had
betrayed his love, and destroyed that quality in
it which is essential and eternal.</p>
<p class="pnext">"One <em class="italics">must</em> look up," he said, and looked down
on her as she sat there, her face covered with her
hands, very still under the torrent of fierce and
cruel words that burst from him in the bitterness
of outraged love and pride.  Like all reserved
people when driven into breaking silence he said
too much.  Afterwards there was a long silence.  A
curlew flying inland wailed faintly like a dying thing.</p>
<p class="pnext">"I don't see what is before us," he muttered.
"Everything is finished."</p>
<p class="pnext">And at last she spoke--very quietly.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Yes, everything is finished of our life together.
But each of us is free to begin again."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Free!" he echoed ironically, thinking of the
mystical fatalistic threads that had bound and
tangled them together from the first.  "You and
I will never be free of each other."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Oh, yes--we are already.  Listen!  I want to
tell you something that I ought to have told
you long ago, only I was afraid of ... Ah! never
mind of what I was afraid.  But now that
it is as you have said all over and finished, now
that I see very well that not only do you not love
me, but that you never have loved me and want
nothing so much as to be free of me, I will tell it
you--" and she added fiercely, "with pleasure."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Tell ahead," he said drearily.</p>
<p class="pnext">"I am not your wife, and never have been.
Horace Valdana is alive--has never been dead!"</p>
<p class="pnext">In the solemn mute moments that followed the
curlew wailed again.</p>
<p class="pnext">"What are you saying?" muttered Westenra,
hoarsely.  He had risen to his feet.</p>
<p class="pnext">Then Val began to laugh, not hysterically, but
just soft light-hearted laughter.  She really felt
light-hearted at that moment.  It was as though
something very, very heavy had been lifted from
her shoulders, and she could stand up straight at last.</p>
<p class="pnext">"It can't be true!"  He was muttering like a
man stunned.  "How long have you known?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Oh, what does that matter!" she said.  "It
is <em class="italics">true</em>--that is all that concerns you."  She
reflected a moment.  "But of course my mere
word is of no value to you ... I have proofs
in the house ... letters from him asking me to
go to Canada with him."  She began to laugh
again.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Good God!" muttered Westenra still dazed.
"And Bran?"</p>
<p class="pnext">That sobered her, drying the strange laughter on
her lips and in her heart.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Ah, Bran! ... Yes.  My Brannie!" she
said softly, her voice in those few low-spoken words
expressing all that the woman voice can express of
pity, sorrow, and love.  It was Bran who would
be the victim--Bran who would go fatherless,
homeless, nameless--a vagabond like his mother
with restless heart and wandering feet!</p>
<p class="pnext">"He is mine," said Westenra suddenly.</p>
<p class="pnext">"No, mine," she answered swiftly.  They stood
staring at each other like two duellists.  He lost
sight of all she had been to him--of all that she
must have suffered.  Dazed and horror-struck he
only felt that his world was moving away from
under his feet, and she was trying to rob him of the
last hold, the most dear thing he had ever possessed.</p>
<p class="pnext">"He is mine too ... I believe by law I could
get him."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Law!  Have n't you found out yet that I am
lawless?"  She came close to him, staring into
his eyes, a mocking light in her own.  "You
forget that I am the woman with no soul, no morals,
and no roots, the careless vagabond whom you
feared Haidee to come into contact with
... whom you apologised to your dead mother for
having married...."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Val, you are mad!" he said amazed, white to
the lips.  But she only laughed a little clanking
laugh, and her voice that had so often sounded in
his ears like the wild far music of his own land was
hard now as iron on iron.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Go your ways, my dear Garrett Westenra.
You are free of the woman who burnt your ship!"</p>

<p class="pfirst">Raging he went from English shores.
Raging, broken-hearted, more lonely than ever
in his life before.  Looking backwards to that
voyage on which he and Val had first met, he
realised that his loneliness then was peace and
contentment compared with what he now felt.  He
had known what it was to share life right down
to the core with another human being, and when
that has once been, solitude redoubles its sting.  A
fantastic creature like Val, however uncomfortable
she made life, could not be lost out of it without
leaving a big, aching gap.</p>
<p class="pnext">Yet, there he was on his way back to America,
while in far Jersey Val sat on her rabbit-hutch
staring at the sea with blind eyes, Bran playing
unheeded at her knees, in her ears the faint,
melancholy cry of the curlew.</p>
<p class="pnext">After their wretched parting on St. Brelade's
Cliffs, Westenra had paced the beach all night.
When he reached the farm dawn brightened the
sky, but none of the freshness of morning was in
his drawn face.  Haidee and Val were up, the
fire made, breakfast ready.  They seemed to take
it for granted that he still meant to leave by that
morning's boat for England, and indeed he had
decided that it was the only thing to do.  It would
give him time to review the miserable situation and
look for a way out of it.  But before he went he
encompassed a further interview with Val, though
he got little of it but pain.  She was in that subtle
way of hers <em class="italics">éloignée</em> from him once more, had put
immeasurable distance between them.</p>
<p class="pnext">"I want you to tell me more of this," he said
drearily.  "I must have details to go on before I
can do anything to right the matter."</p>
<p class="pnext">"You cannot right it," she answered.  "It
must be left as it is."</p>
<p class="pnext">"What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"It must never come out that Horace Valdana
is alive.  One cannot so disgrace England."</p>
<p class="pnext">Briefly she related the facts as far as she knew
them, and he saw that she was right.  Impossible
to disgrace a country to right a private affair--even
if the country were one you hated.  But what
a situation!  There seemed to him to be no way
out of it.  Val, for a deep reason of her own,
withheld from him the fact of Valdana's broken health.
She wished him to feel absolutely free of her.  She
kept repeating that, with sardonic inflexible eyes.</p>
<p class="pnext">"You see, you are free!  What more do you ask?"</p>
<p class="pnext">He asked much more, but with that mocking
smile on her pale lips he would not tell her so.</p>
<p class="pnext">"I want my son," he said coldly.</p>
<p class="pnext">"<em class="italics">My</em> son," she answered, and that found them
once more at the pitch at which they had parted
the night before, reason withdrawn, cold fury in its
place.  Only by a great effort had he controlled
himself.</p>
<p class="pnext">"I leave him with you, in trust."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Because you must," she answered, eyes flickering
with bitter triumph.  "But will you not take
Haidee before ill comes to her?"</p>
<p class="pnext">He was helpless before the smile that writhed
upon her stiff lips.  What did she mean by these
gibes concerning Haidee and his dead mother,
which she flung at him like javelins?  How had
she read those secrets of his soul that he had never
revealed to any one, scarcely acknowledged to
himself?  Had she with her queer almost
clairvoyant instinct known all along and mocked and
disdained him in her heart from the first?  If he
thought of her tenderness to Bran and to himself
when he lay ill, her comradeship, her valiant gaiety,
he could not believe it.  When he looked at her
mocking disdainful eyes he could believe anything.</p>
<p class="pnext">"No; I leave Haidee in trust with you too,"
he said, then had been obliged to kiss the children
hurriedly, and go on his way, or lose the boat.</p>
<p class="pnext">In spite of his original intention to do so he did
not return to Jersey before sailing to America.
After black nights of reflection he saw that there
was nothing to be gained by facing Val again in
the mood that possessed her.  The moment they
looked into each other's eyes cold reason would
once more withdraw from them and the fury of
wounded love take its place.  It was better to let
Time do its work upon their trouble.  So he sailed
for America without seeing her or the children
again, though it hurt him deeply to do it.  And his
days and nights upon the ship were haunted by the
face of the woman in grey.  Never since the
voyage on the <em class="italics">Bavaric</em> had he dreamed that dream,
but now never a night came without it.  Towards
the last part of the voyage, when calm had come to
him, he wrote her a letter in which he hid the love
that still ached in him, but tried to revive a little
the old understanding comradeship they had shared.</p>
<p class="pnext">But there was too much of compassion in that
letter, and Val was sick of his compassion.  Women
<em class="italics">can</em> get sick of compassion when it leaves no room
for self-respect.</p>
<div class="center transition">
<p class="pfirst">――――</p>
</div>
<p class="pfirst">She stayed on in Jersey not because he asked her
but because she must.  One would call it existing
rather than living as far as she was concerned.
She felt as though her brain were dead and she had
only her body left, that body which, however glad
she would be to lay it down, she must conserve
and take care of for the sake of Bran.  For Haidee,
too, she had a kind of responsible mother-feeling,
though Haidee never encouraged tenderness in any
one.  But the case of Bran was different; the child
of two such nervous people could not be otherwise
than nervously organised, though of fine build
and stamina, and Val knew that under any care but
hers he would probably grow up a weakling.  No,
she must not die!  But she tried to let her mind
do so for a while, so that she might suffer less.
She essayed to turn herself into a kind of vegetable;
read nothing, talked to no one but the children,
indulged in no kind of mental occupation.  Only
she worked out in the open as much as possible,
with her nervous incapable hands, and at least
she got a beautiful flower garden together.</p>
<p class="pnext">She never saw or spoke to any one but the
children.  When Haidee got back from school they
would all work together in the garden or clean out
the stable, or make bran mashes for the pony colic,
or run the dogs, and watch the chickens and rabbits
in the open, though enthusiasm for this last
occupation was distinctly on the wane.  The only things
any of them cared for now were the bees and the
flowers.  They did not make money out of these,
but then the fowls did not make money either,
only pretended to until the grain bill came in.</p>
<p class="pnext">Bran was always to be found in the vicinity of
the beehives, and at first Val had been terrified,
but later she came to believe him one of the
"band of little brothers" whom bees do not
sting.  Haidee could take no liberties with the
strange, wise insects, and had a holy fear of them,
but they were Bran's passionate loves.</p>
<p class="pnext">As for eggs and chickens, and fat hens that would
no longer lay, they were all sick of them as articles
of diet.  Haidee, who in New York days was used
to attack with relish three city eggs of assorted
flavours mixed in a tumbler, now turned away in
weariness and disgust from the brown-shelled ones
fresh from the nest.</p>
<p class="pnext">And the rabbits were a thorn in the flesh, and a
weariness to the sole of the foot!  Eternally they
were killed by stoats, eaten by rats, stolen, or else
dug their way out from under the runs and fled for
the open.  If these modes of escape all failed,
Bran, in his small way, would do what he could
for them.  When he came toddling indoors to
declare with an effulgent smile his love for Haidee
she would start up snapping:</p>
<p class="pnext">"Yes, I know what <em class="italics">that</em> means.  You've let
the rabbits out.  You always have when you love
me.  Have you, Bran?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Well, by aksdent, Haidee...."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Oh, I know your aksdents...."</p>
<p class="pnext">With blank faces she and Val would rush from
the house and scoot after the scurrying rabbits.
The latter usually got the best of the game and
achieved liberty.</p>
<p class="pnext">The truth had to be faced that there was no
money to be made out of the farm.  High hopes
of a fortune had long since fallen to the dust.
Chickens and rabbits are very charming to watch
at their antics in the sunshine, but depending
upon them for a living, unless you are an expert
poultry farmer, is waste of time.  Val realised it
at last, and that other ways and means for
obtaining money must be reflected upon.  She had no
intention of accepting another rap of Westenra's
for either her own or Bran's support.  So one
day she sat down and wrote to Branker Preston,
asking him if he could find an opening for some
"Wanderfoot" articles.</p>
<p class="pnext">"I cannot travel," she wrote, "but I have a
good store of unused material in the cupboards of
my mind, and I need money."  Preston answered
that he would not be long in finding a demand for
anything she could supply.  When, however, the
demand came she found herself curiously unable
to cope with it.  The task of sitting down to write
newspaper articles after a lapse of more than two
years into domesticity was not an easy one.  As
love and maternity had absorbed her mother's
art, so in a smaller degree the same things had
encroached upon Val's gift.  Added to which was a
period of unbroken intercourse with chickens and
rabbits, enlivened only by digging in the garden
or running the pony up and down when he got colic.
Such occupations are excellent for the health, and
may even induce a good working philosophy, but
they do not make the intellect to scintillate like
the stars, nor bestow distinction upon that elusive
quality in writing which is known as style.  She
found that when she tried to think connectedly
on abstract subjects things slithered out of her
mind and left a headache behind.  After a few
days, in which her brain seemed to act in delirium,
and the written results read to her like the ravings
of a suddenly liberated lunatic, she threw down
her pen in despair.</p>
<p class="pnext">"It is this brute of an island!  I can never write
here," she cried desperately.  She had suffered
too much there, and her instinct was always to flee
from places where sorrow had smitten her, to save
her soul alive before it was injured beyond aid.
Such places seemed to have a power for evil over
her.  Moreover her feet had long ached to be gone
from the small, cramped island.  It had served
its purpose.  The children were healthy and strong,
her own body recuperated.  Now that she must
take up her pen once more, plainly it was time to
pull stakes.  There was no inspiration for her in
Jersey.</p>
<p class="pnext">For another thing, she began to be afraid that
if she remained much longer she might become a
serious criminal; that is to say, one upon whom
the law would lay hands.  It was Farmer Scone
who helped her to this conclusion and her final
decision to go.</p>
<p class="pnext">For months he had been making himself
unpleasant--a long series of petty vexations and
systemised annoyance--stoning her fowls,
complaining to the police that her dogs worried his
cows, letting his cattle break down her hedges, and
encouraging his labourers to annoy Haidee by
sniggering over the hedge when she was busy
with the pony.  Added to these things he had once
more started walking through her grounds by the
old disputed "right of way" past the back door.</p>
<p class="pnext">One morning she and Haidee, just going out to
fire at some crows in the fruit garden, ran into him
and his grinning labourer carrying their scythes
to a far hayfield.  Val called him back, and
speaking very self-controlledly told him that it must be
understood, once and for all, that she would not
permit this trespassing.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Great Galumps!" he responded as usual, "and
what will you do to me?  Is it your husband from
America, who only comes to see you for one day a
year, that 'll be punching my head?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"No," said Val, white to the lips, and raising her
rook-rifle.  "It is I that will be putting a hole
through your large and very unsightly paunch."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Yes, do, Val, <em class="italics">do</em>.  Take a pot-shot at him--give
him one in the tummy!" urged Haidee
ecstatically.  "Shall I get my revolver too?"</p>
<p class="pnext">She hopped up-stairs, and Farmer Scone moved
on at the double-quick, rather alarmed, for he did
not at all like the look in Val's eyes, and to be sure
no one knew what such creatures might do!  He
half determined to go down to the court-house at
once and, complaining of menaces, "have the law
on them," but reflected in time that as he was not
"Jersey-born" he might not get his case, while
running a possible risk of being fined for
trespassing.  He decided that his system of petty
annoyance was the best.</p>
<p class="pnext">In the meantime Val, too, was deciding
something.  On going into the house she met Haidee
coming out, gaily priming her revolver.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Put it away, Haidee," she said wearily.
"Don't you understand I only said that in my rage
with the insolent brute.  You must never shoot
at people.  Awful trouble might come of it."</p>
<p class="pnext">Haidee's face darkened sulkily.</p>
<p class="pnext">"One can't do anything in this rotten island,"
she complained.</p>
<p class="pnext">"We can get out of it," said Val, and Haidee
brightened.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Where would we go?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Oh, I don't know ... anywhere ... anywhere
where we 'll never see a rabbit or a fowl
again.  I think I shall go mad if I stay among them
another day."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Me too--I'm sick of the beasts.  Look at
that cock-eyed eagle staring at us.  Sh--sh, you
brutes!"</p>
<p class="pnext">"I wish I 'd never seen a hen in my life," said
Val savagely.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Let's get an axe and slay them all before we
go," suggested Haidee.  Suddenly her face grew
long.  "But where are we going to get the money from?"</p>
<p class="pnext">The financial situation was such that even the
children understood its simplicity; though if it
had been more complicated Val would never have
dreamed of not sharing it with them.  Bran was
able to tell to a penny how much the family purse
contained, while Haidee as a matter of fact
possessed a far finer appreciation of money values
than either Westenra or Val.</p>
<p class="pnext">"We 've got the rent," said the latter thoughtfully,
and Haidee looked up quickly.  With the
lawlessness of youth she immediately jumped to
the conclusion that Val meant to skip with the sum
that was due to the landlord on September
quarter-day, now close at hand.  It was only a fourth of
thirty-six pounds, but still, when times are hard
and a sea voyage in contemplation, nine pounds
are not to be despised.  Val quickly dispelled this
bright notion.</p>
<p class="pnext">"I 'm not going to rob the landlord.  All he will
have to do is sell the farm-stock and my pretty
London things, which of course we 'll leave.  They
will more than pay the rent for the rest of the
lease, and enough left over to pay the bills we
owe.  We won't take anything but our clothes and
a few books."</p>
<p class="pnext">"What about Joy?  Let's sell him.  You know
that old Farmer Le Seur offered fifteen pounds for
him.  I 'll go and tell him this morning, shall I?"</p>
<p class="pnext">Val reflected a moment, and came to the conclusion
that it would be juster to Westenra to sell the
pony at that price than leave him to be sold for
the small sum they owed, so she gave Haidee the
desired permission.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Oh, hurray! ... Oh, Val, what a lark!"  Haidee
pranced and capered like a Bashi-bazouk.
"Let's go and pack."</p>
<p class="pnext">They flew up-stairs and woke Bran to the news.</p>
<p class="pnext">"We 're going away, Brannie Bran ... in a ship!"</p>
<p class="pnext">Bran, sitting up in bed like a squdgy Japanese
idol, took hold of his toes as though they were a
bunch of rosebuds.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Are we going to daddy?" he asked solemnly,
and Val hid her face in his flannel nightgown.</p>
<p class="pnext">"No, my Wing."  She added on the spur of the
moment, "We 're going to France."</p>
<p class="pnext">He reflected awhile.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Oh, dear buck!" he sighed at last (only he said
jeer for dear).  It was one of his expressions
signifying disappointment, and Val felt a pang.  But
she would not be saddened, and soon had the
children as wild as herself, dashing about the
house and packing up, so glad was she to be setting
out from the place where she had been a vegetable
so long, and yet known such keen unhappiness.</p>
<p class="pnext">Having got together all their trunks, the band of
Ishmaelites boarded a cab for St. Helier.  No one
would have dreamed for a moment that they were
setting out for another land.  They drove down
and spent the night opposite the quay, and sailed
the next morning for Granville.  Just at the last
Val thought of sending Haidee to see if there were
any letters at the post-office.  As it happened,
one had been forwarded by Branker Preston, but
she did not read it till they were on board ship.</p>
<p class="pnext">It was from Valdana, to say that, as she would
not come, he was setting forth alone in excellent
health to start life anew in Canada.</p>

<p class="pfirst">March was in like a lamb, and on a fair
morning all the windows of Villa Duval
stood open, letting in floods of sunlight, gusts of
warm sea-scented wind, and the sound of waves
crushing and swinging up and down the sandy
beaches of Normandy.  Perhaps it was because <em class="italics">père</em>
Duval who built it was an old sailor and lighthouse-keeper
that the rooms of the Villa were curiously
like ship-cabins with their wooden walls and bare
deck-like floors.  Looking out through the
porthole windows at the view of blue waves rippling
from the bay up the river it would not have
seemed unnatural to find the Villa gently rocking
with the incoming tide.  Down in the garden
<em class="italics">père</em> Duval hoeing weeds fostered the illusion by
croaking the ghost of an old sea song that he had
lilted bravely enough forty years before from his
fishing boat or when he kept the lighthouse at
Les Sept Isles.  He had built the Villa with his
own hands after the sea and he had done with each
other; but not for his own habitation.  With its
pink and blue tables and chairs made and lovingly
painted by himself, beds from the Paris Bon
Marché, stout bed-linen that had been part of <em class="italics">mère</em>
Duval's marriage portion, marvellous mirrors and
decorated crockery bought with trading coupons
that represented many pounds of coffee from the
Café Debray Company, it was considered far too
wonderful and shining to be the habitation of a
mere Normandy peasant.  So the old man and his
granddaughter Hortense lived in a couple of rooms
beneath the wonder house, which was perched high
and reached only by a flight of steps to the front
door.  The Villa lay nearer to the beach than any
other in Mascaret, and for this reason was always
one of the first to be taken by summer visitors.
But at the end of the previous summer <em class="italics">père</em> Duval
had achieved an extraordinary piece of luck in
letting it for the whole autumn and winter to some
mad Americans, who were now fixtures for the
coming summer also.</p>
<p class="pnext">The mad Americans had received this title by
reason of their eccentric habits and customs, to
say nothing of their clothes.  They never wore
anything, week-day or Sunday, but red woollen
sweaters and short skirts, and the girl most
shamelessly showed her legs bare to the knee.  Also
the whole band of three bathed in the sea on the
coldest of winter days.  Evidently their mental
condition was known elsewhere than in Mascaret,
for more than once when they were staying at Les
Fusains, the villa they had first taken, letters came
from America addressed to Les Insains, and the
occupants of Les Fusains had received these bland
and unblinking from the hands of Jean Baptiste
the postman.  The postmaster, who understood
a little English, had explained the jest to his
village cronies, adding that the writing of the
eldest mad one so much resembled the writing of
a hen, that it was small wonder that mistakes
were made over her address.  That they were
Americans was certain, for every three months
American Express money orders came for them,
and the eldest Insain promptly changed these for
French money <em class="italics">mandats</em> and forwarded them to the
Credit Lyonnais in Paris.  These <em class="italics">fantastiques</em>
doings deeply impressed the villagers, and had
provided them with many an interesting hour of
gossip over their black coffee and cider.</p>
<p class="pnext">And the "Insane ones" never knew a thing
about it.  On this mild March morning they were
variously engaged in simple and peaceful
occupations not unsuitable to those of feeble mind.
Upstairs, one of them, a girl of sixteen with bare feet
and hair swinging in long brown braids, was swishing
the sheets from the beds and flicking all stray
garments into corners.  She considered that she
was being certainly very noble and useful.  Her
face bore the expression of complacent beneficence
assumed by those who are aware that they
are doing the work of another person, and doing
it ten times better than that other person.  She
wore a bathing dress that was slightly small for
her, made combination-fashion, of twill whose
pristine scarlet had long since been bleached by
sea salt to a faint shell-pink.  It was embroidered
by black and white darns of a primitive, not to
say aboriginal description.  Her bare arms were
decorated with some beaten copper bracelets of
the New Art school, but her slim legs, brown and
very long from the knee down, were innocent of
stockings.  She was tanned all over with the faint,
transparent, sherry-coloured tan of a woodland
nymph, and her delicately curved cheek wore the
tint of woodland berries, wine-brown eyes full of
sunshine and shadows, long, flickering, silky hair,
a red, sulky mouth.</p>
<p class="pnext">Haidee had grown into a beauty.</p>
<p class="pnext">She swished the sheets of heavy linen from the
beds and cast them in rumpled heaps upon the
floor, taking many a glance out at the sea,
whistling a tune at one moment, in another echoing with
her high-pitched rather husky treble the lay of
<em class="italics">père</em> Duval.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line">"Le bon Jesu marchait sur l'eau</div>
<div class="line">Va sans peur mon petit bateau."</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="pfirst">In the room below, listening to Haidee's rustling
feet and the song of the sea, was Val Valdana.
Two sheets of the <em class="italics">Paris Daily Mail</em> were spread
upon the table to protect the cloth, while in wistful
and desultory fashion she prepared the vegetables
for lunch.  Her thin brown fingers decked in their
strange stones and old enamels were stained with
potato juice, and a number of small new potatoes
lay dimpling pink at the bottom of an earthenware
bowl glazed brown without and pale yellow within.
But Val's thoughts were not with the potatoes.
She often let her hands fall among the curly peel
scrapings on the table, and gazed sombrely, almost
sightlessly before her.  Shipwreck was in her eyes,
and exile, and all the bitterness of bright hopes
broken, and talent lying fallow and useless.  Her
lips looked as if the laughter had been bitten out
of them in an attempt to keep within the desperate
cry of her heart.</p>
<p class="pnext">It was as well perhaps that overhead Haidee
suddenly decided that helping to get lunch would
be more amusing than making beds.  Hasty and
conclusive sounds denoted that she was "finishing
up," directing by means of a few masterly flicks
with a bath towel, all scraps of paper, stockings,
stray shoes, letters, etc., into a proper and decent
seclusion under the beds.  Then her feet rustled
on the stairs and through the kitchen, stayed for
a moment at the front door from whence she threw
a laugh and a call to Bran playing in the old boat
across the road.  A moment later the shell-pink
bathing costume became part of the dining-room
decoration, and its wearer, seated before the <em class="italics">Daily
Mail</em>, attacked the potatoes with the same nobility
of purpose she had used for the bedrooms.  Val,
leaning back in her chair, her hands listlessly on
the table before her, her face full of a moody
weariness, had plainly struck work.  A silence prevailed
broken only by the scratch of Haidee's knife on
the potatoes.  When she sometimes needed the
handle of her knife to delicately scratch the tip of
her nose she ceased work for an instant, while she
glanced at Valentine, or through the open window
at Bran's head bobbing up and down in the old
<em class="italics">Jules Duval</em>.  When her eyes strayed to the blue
moving surface beyond she gave a sigh.</p>
<p class="pnext">"What a day for a sail, Val!"</p>
<p class="pnext">Val waked from her sombre dream, and looking
for the first time with some shade of recognition at
her, became aware of the bathing costume.</p>
<p class="pnext">"I think you want to die of pneumonia, Haidee!"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Oh, I 'm not cold, and it's so jolly and loose.
It makes me feel as though summer is here
already.  Don't I wish it were June instead of
rotten old March!"</p>
<p class="pnext">She plumped a potato into the bowl and dexterously
used the handle of the knife to flick a long
streak of hair over her left shoulder.</p>
<p class="pnext">"I do believe it's warm enough for a second
swim to-day, Val ... let's hurry up and go
down to the beach, shall we? ... Yes, do, let's."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Who will get <em class="italics">dèjeuner</em>?" inquired Val, laconically.</p>
<p class="pnext">"I could kick that rotten Hortense!" responded
Haidee savagely, and all her cowboy instincts came
out and sat upon her face.  "Do you believe she
is really sick?" she asked, in the manner of one
propounding a problem in Algebra.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Of course not....  She's sick of doing
housework, that's all....  Any one would be."</p>
<p class="pnext">Haidee considered this awhile scowling, but her
thoughts passed to pleasanter subjects, and her
face presently regained its harmony.  From the
kitchen came a sound like the purring of a man-eater
of Tsavo enjoying a full meal, but it was only
the boiler, which always purred when the stove
was red-hot.  Haidee made haste to finish the
potatoes though her eyes considered many things.
She regarded a brown print of Carlyle on the wall
above Val's head, and wondered as often before if
he had really gone about London with a hat of that
shape!  And had he really heaved half bricks at
the people he did not like? ... that tickled
her cowboy humour and she smiled broadly.
How beautifully Mr. Whistler had draped that
nice gendarme's cloak over the thin legs of the
Sage of Craigenputtock!</p>
<p class="pnext">Her glance wandered again to the expanse of
blue water sparkling in the sun--the Barleville
Bay and the river were both full now, and blue,
blue!  She wished she could collect all that
blueness and put it into a jewel to hang round Val's
neck.  Val looked lovely with bits of blue on
her--like an Arab Madonna, though she could also
look like Mary Madgalene.  Sometimes when she
had Bran on her lap she looked happy and
contented, but with far-away hills in her eyes--just
like St. Anne in da Vinci's picture where Mary is
sitting on her mother's knees while Jesus plays on
the floor.</p>
<p class="pnext">At other times, when she twisted a grey scarf
around her hair and ran in the wind Val could look
like a Spanish dancing girl, or a mad Malay.
Again an artist in the Latin Quarter had done a
water-colour of her in which, with her head a little
on one side and a wistful inquiring look in her
smoke-blue eyes, she reminded Haidee of a baby
lion cub once seen in the Bronx Park Zoo.  But
to-day Val looked old and sad; her yellow serpent
was eating at her heart, and Haidee knew why.
The American mail had reached Cherbourg the
day before, but no letter had come to Villa Duval.
Hardly any letters came from Westenra now,
except an occasional one to Haidee and the regular
money draft every three months which Val as
regularly sent away to a Paris bank and never
touched except for paying Haidee's school fees.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Never mind, Val," said Haidee, half in
response to her own thoughts, half in continuation
of their brief conversation.  "As soon as your
play is finished we 'll kick Hortense out" (Haidee's
mind still dealt in kicks) "and get a proper <em class="italics">bonne</em>.
We may be able to afford old M'am Legallais,
don't you think?  They say she can make lovely
onion soup."</p>
<p class="pnext">"The play will never be finished," said Val
darkly.  "Pots and pans won't let me finish
it--they spoil the scenery.  I <em class="italics">think</em> potatoes and
cabbages!  You can smell garlic and stewed veal
in the love scenes.  Oh!  How can one go on
living?  If it were n't for you and Bran I would
cut my head off."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Cockerels!" said Haidee, in the same way as a
rude boy might say "rats!"  "Cut your hair off
instead," she counselled unfeelingly, "it is getting
awfully thin."</p>
<p class="pnext">Val sprang up and ran like lightning into the
next room, where there was a mirror on the wall.
Her hair lay in feathery clouds about her face and
forehead, and there seemed to be heaps of it, but
it was true that when she came to do it up one
small comb at the back held all in place.  Yet she
remembered the time not long ago when it had
fallen to her waist as long and thick as Haidee's own.</p>
<p class="pnext">"It is this confounded writing plays--and
stewing veal!" she murmured, and stared at
herself desperately.  She had the eyes of the exile
who never for one moment forgets his exile; only,
it was not one country she mourned but many.
Poor Val! she was too, that rare unhappy thing,
a born lover.  Never for one moment was the man
she loved out of her mind; always, always he
was there, haunting the rooms of her memory and
the <em class="italics">chapelle ardente</em> of her heart, perfuming every
thought, influencing every action.  Because of
him she cried aloud now:</p>
<p class="pnext">"I <em class="italics">will</em> have it cut off, Haidee.  Go and tell the
barber to come this afternoon.  I 'll have it cut
close--shaved--so that it <em class="italics">must</em> grow thick again.
I won't be an old woman without hair!  Oh,
Haidee--an old bald hag whom no one loves!"  Desolation
crept into her voice, it had long dwelt
in her eyes.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Don't be a silly, Val," said matter-of-fact
Haidee.  "I love you and Bran loves you and
Garry loves you."</p>
<p class="pnext">"No, no--Garry hates me--he never writes!"  She
flung herself into a chair, and two of the salt
bitter tears that were always lurking in the
background, but which she seldom shed, oozed out of
her eyes as if they had come from a long distance
and gave her great pain.  Haidee made no attempt
to comfort her, but presently went out of the house
to where Bran was just casting off anchor from the
<em class="italics">Jules</em> in view of a voyage to New York.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Val 's crying," she said briefly.</p>
<p class="pnext">"What for?" asked Bran, but immediately letting
go anchor and beginning to climb in a business-like
way over the side of the boat.  The eye that he
cocked at Haidee was of the same smoke-blue as
his mother's, and held the same wistful lion-cub
glance.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Just the old yellow snake," said Haidee,
already on her way back to put on the potatoes,
for well she knew that if she did not there would be
none for lunch that day.</p>
<p class="pnext">Bran found Val swiftly, and climbing upon her
knees began to kiss her wet eyes.  She kissed him
back passionately, holding him with such convulsive
tightness that he was at last obliged to give
a small howl.</p>
<p class="pnext">"O--h!  you're hurting me, Mammie--just a
<em class="italics">little</em> bit."</p>
<p class="pnext">She kissed him again then, comforting him,
reproaching herself, and drying away her tears
in his bright hair.</p>
<p class="pnext">"You know I would n't hurt my little cubby-cub
for a million pounds."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Would you for a million millions?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Never!"</p>
<p class="pnext">"For a ship as big as the <em class="italics">Tu-te-onic</em>?"  Bran
adored ships, and could imagine most crimes being
committed to acquire one.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Never, never, <em class="italics">jamais</em>!"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Not if some one came and asked you to give
me just a <em class="italics">teeny weeny</em> hurt?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"If some one came to me and said, 'I 'll give you
the whole sea full of ships with all the beautiful
things in the world in them, if you just crush your
little Bran's finger till he howls,' I would say,
'You get out of here, Beel, or I keel you.'"</p>
<p class="pnext">Bran gave a joyful prance at the familiar
quotation from Stephen Crane's story of Mexico Bill,
long since transformed by Val into an exciting
game, in which he performed the rô1e of Bill, and
she and Haidee were two Mexican braves in
sombreros and draped blankets.  He was just about to
propose a full-dress rehearsal of this drama when
Val, reading the inspiration in his eye and feeling
quite unfit for any such diversion, headed his
mind off in another direction.</p>
<p class="pnext">"If any one came and offered <em class="italics">you</em> a million
pounds to hurt your mammie, would you do it?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"No," said Bran, adding darkly, "<em class="italics">but I'd ask
him where he lived.</em>"</p>
<p class="pnext">"And then?"  Val smiled into his hair.  There
was a pause; at last in a soft whisper spoke Bran
the brigand:</p>
<p class="pnext">"I 'd take a sword and go and pierce him in the
night and get his million pounds for you."  He
embraced her ardently.  It was characteristic of
her that she did not rebuke him for the lawlessness
of his plan.  She thoroughly understood the
spirit that could rob, pillage, and even do murder
for the sake of a loved one.</p>
<p class="pnext">They began to laugh and play.  Val suddenly
fell in love with her plan to have her hair cut off.
She arranged a red handkerchief on her head,
turban-fashion, to see how she would look.  Eventually
she decided to wear a fez and return to her habit
of cigarette smoking to match her new appearance.
Haidee declared that she too would love a fez, so
Val sat down and wrote to the Army and Navy
Stores for two, on the condition that Haidee went
to the village at once to tell the barber to come
immediately after lunch.  Now that she had
decided to have her hair cut the thing could not
be done soon enough to please her.</p>
<p class="pnext">Regretfully Haidee changed her bathing-dress
for her navy-blue skirt and scarlet sweater, also
a floppy hat of brown <em class="italics">suède</em> for which Val had
paid a pound in Jersey at a time when they were
very hard up indeed, just because it suited Haidee's
peculiar style of cowboy beauty.  Looking like
a handsome conspirator, she sallied forth down
the road that led to the village, for Villa Duval lay
a good half-mile from Mascaret, with nothing
between but the blacksmith's shop, a hotel, and
a couple of fishermen's cottages.</p>
<p class="pnext">The blacksmith's wife's brother, known to all
the world, including Haidee and Bran, as "<em class="italics">mon
oncle</em>" was whitewashing the outside of the
blacksmith's cottage against the day when the rose-tree
trained over the door would burst into leaf and
large pink roses.  A little farther on, in front of
the hotel, two men were scattering red brick dust
over the long flower beds on the sloping lawns,
preparatory to planting out the letters "Grand
Hotel de la Mer" in blue and white lobelias, thus
combining patriotism with an excellent advertisement
of the hotel.  When the May excursion boat
moored alongside the <em class="italics">digue</em>, the first thing to greet
the eyes of the passengers would be the blue and
white lettering on the brick-red beds.</p>
<p class="pnext">These signs and symbols of approaching summer
cheered the heart of Haidee, and she hummed a
little song to herself, as she went light-foot along the
curving picturesque terrace that led to the village.</p>
<p class="pnext">Already she seemed to smell upon the air the
luscious heavy scent of travellers' joy that would
presently hang in waxen bunches from the high
walls of La Terrasse and Villa Albert.  These
were the only two villas on the Terrace, and they
pertained variously to a Paris specialist in
madness, and the controller-general of a great French
bank.  Between the two villas lay a large and
valuable plot of ground, overgrown and tangled
up with creepers, brambles, cabbage stalks, rose
bushes, and seeding onions, set in the midst of
which was a dilapidated one-room hut.  The
hut was the fly in the ointment of the specialist in
lunacy and the controller-general.  They could
do nothing to remove this picturesque slum from
their gates, for old <em class="italics">veuve</em> Michel, who lived there
and drank two bottles of cognac a day and sang
gay ribald songs by night, owned the land by right
of some old French statute, and no one could turn
her out for as long as she lived.  Haidee and Bran
considered <em class="italics">veuve</em> Michel a very charming person
indeed.  She was fat and merry and gentle, called
them her nice little hens and gave them apples and
pears (for she also owned an orchard up the cliff)
all through the winter when there was no fruit to
be got any nearer than Cherbourg.  Naturally they
liked and appreciated the old woman.  Haidee
had a good mind to go in and pay her a visit, but
she decided it was better not, as old <em class="italics">veuve</em> would
just be sleeping off her morning bottle of cognac
preparatory to starting on the afternoon one;
also Haidee remembered that she was hungry, and
had better hurry back and help get lunch.  Still she
could not help stopping once or twice to examine
for signs of little pink tips the lower branches of
the tamarisk-trees which grew on one side of the
Terrace--on the other side was the grey stone river
wall with the tide lapping blue against it.</p>
<p class="pnext">Haidee loved tamarisks with a joy that she was
sure was unholy because they looked so wicked
and painted somehow when they were all dressed
out in their pink feathers.  She fancied that
Jezebel must have had a bunch of them stuck like
an aigrette in her beautifully <em class="italics">coiffée</em> hair, and the
same pink tint on her cheeks when she looked out
of the window for the last time.  Anyway why
were tamarisks the only trees to be found growing
in the ruins of Babylon?  And why had she read
somewhere, that in the days of ancient Rome
tamarisks were bound around the heads of criminals?
It was a nuisance to have to forsake these
interesting meditations to enter the little
soap-scented shop of the village barber, but she stayed
no longer than to bid him come to the Villa at
three o'clock to cut off Madame's hair.  Next she
called at Lemonier's to command a sack of coal,
and noted that Lemonier had evidently been drunk
again, for Madame had a black eye.  It was funny
to think that such a jolly big red man should be so
cruel!  Haidee meditated on this subject on the
return journey, also on the horrible price of
coal--sixty-five francs a ton and it disappeared like
lightning.  No one seemed to know why "Carr-<em class="italics">diff</em>,"
as they called it, should be so dear.  Hortense,
closely questioned on the subject by Val
anxious for information, said that it must be
because the people in England hated the French
and were still angry that Normandy did not belong
to them.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Well, have n't you got any coal mines in your
own blessed country?" asked Haidee.</p>
<p class="pnext">"<em class="italics">Certainement!</em>" Hortense had replied indignantly.
"We have Newcas-sel!"</p>
<div class="center transition">
<p class="pfirst">――――</p>
</div>
<p class="pfirst">The barber arrived at three o'clock, and Val
sat trembling before her dressing-table.  She had
arranged two mirrors so that she could view the
whole proceeding, but as soon as the barber
commenced she closed her eyes tight.  Bran and
Haidee stationed themselves at either side of the
table to see fair play.</p>
<p class="pnext">The barber was frankly amazed at the decision
of Madame to cut off her feathery hair.  Even at
the last moment he asked--holding it up in his
hands and shaking it out in sprays:</p>
<p class="pnext">"Does Madame realise what a change it will
make in her appearance?  Would it not be better
if Madame had it merely cut short, leaving about
two inches all round <em class="italics">à la Jeanne d'Arc</em>, so--?"  He
stuck his little pudgy fingers out below her ears
to show the desirable length.</p>
<p class="pnext">"No, no, no!" cried Val, without opening her
eyes.  "Does he think I want to look like a pony
with my mane hogged!  Cut it off close, it <em class="italics">must</em>
grow long and thick as it used to do.  Tell him,
Haidee."</p>
<p class="pnext">Haidee told him as much as it was good for him
to know--no mention of ponies.</p>
<p class="pnext">"<em class="italics">Bon!</em>" said Monsieur le Barbier agreeably,
but he looked doubtful, thinking to himself that
hair seldom grew much after the age of thirty, and
the lady looked well that.  When one side was
gone Val opened her eyes and gave a deep cry.
If it could have been replaced then, she would have
abandoned her idea and made the best of what she
had.  As it was she closed her eyes again, but
during the rest of the operation great tears rolled
down her face upon her tightly clasped hands.  And
when all was over the children were swept from the
room and she locked herself in with her heart's
bitterness.  Even Bran was not permitted to
comfort her.</p>
<p class="pnext">It is true that nothing makes a greater difference
to the appearance of a woman than to cut off her
hair.  The tale of every sin she has committed and
every sorrow she has suffered seems to be written
bare and unsheltered upon her face for all the world
to read.  What subtle alleviation there is in a
frame of hair round the face of a sinner it is hard to
say: but it is a problem whether Mary Magdalene,
with all her shining story of repentance would have
appealed to the love and chivalry of the world in
quite the same way if she had been handed down
through the ages without her wondrous hair.</p>
<p class="pnext">When Valentine Valdana looked in the glass at
her pale, oval face with no darkness above it to
soften the fine lines of her temples, faintly hollowed
cheeks, and sombre eyes whose defect appeared to
have become suddenly accentuated, she longed in
shame and dismay for a mask.  It seemed to her
that she had indecently exposed her sorrows to
the world; that exile, misery, and all the failures of
her life were plainly written for even the most
unintelligent eye to read.  A curious sense too of
having done something disloyal to others in
revealing her unhappiness crept into her mind for
an instant, but she made haste to dismiss it, and
would not even specify the vague "others" to
herself.  None knew better than she the power of
a beloved hand to strike deepest, to hollow out
cheeks, sharpen temples, and put shadows into
eyes: but she would never have admitted it.  Hers
was no accusing heart.  She blamed nobody but
herself for her failures--not even the Fate that
had bestowed on her that double nature of artist
and lover which rarely if ever makes for happiness.
She only felt the despair of the convict and almost
wished herself one, so that she might hide in a cell.
At length she sought her gay scarf of asphodel-blue
and arranged it over her head like a nun's veil.
It was thus that she presented herself to the
children in the kindly dusk.  Supper already stood
upon the table.  Haidee displayed unusual tact,
but Bran was full of curiosity.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Are you always going to wear that wale tied
on you?" he inquired.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Until my hair grows long again," said poor
Val, biting her lip painfully.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Sleep in it too?"  Val nodded, and Haidee made
haste to help Bran to <em class="italics">pommes frites</em> which he loved.</p>
<p class="pnext">Next morning, Bran waking up and throwing
out an arm for his matutinal hug, encountered
something strange to his touch: something round,
bumpy, and slightly scrubby, very different to the
soft nest he was used to dabble his hand in as soon
as he woke.  The blue scarf had slipped down
while Val slept and her shorn head lay cruelly
outlined upon the pillow.  Bran knelt up and
considered her in consternation mingled with pity,
then finding himself in the attitude of prayer,
mechanically crossed himself and murmured his
morning orison, his eyes still fixed on his mother's
head:</p>
<p class="pnext">"Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, I give you my heart,
take it please, and preserve it from sin."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, I give you my soul
and my life.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, help me in my last
agony.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, grant that I live and
die in thy holy company.  Amen."</p>
<p class="pnext">Immediately afterwards humour, that Irish
vice, overcame all gentler feelings; like a certain
famous Bishop of Down, Bran would lose a friend
for a joke.  He woke Val with a cruel jest:</p>
<p class="pnext">"<em class="italics">Bon jour, Monsieur le Curé!</em>"</p>
<p class="pnext">The curé of Mascaret was a Breton as rugged as
his country, with haggard spiritual eyes and an
upper lip you could built a fort on, as the saying is;
he intensified his uncomeliness by wearing his hair
so close-shaved that it was impossible to say where
his <em class="italics">tonsure</em> began or ended.  To be told by her
loving but candid son that she resembled this
good man was a cruel thrust to Val, and the
memory of it darkened life for many days to come.
She wrapped herself in gloom and the blue veil,
and nothing more was heard of the fez cap and
cigarettes except that in good time the Stores
forwarded them and the French Customs taxed
them.  After once trying on the fez and finding
herself the image of a sallow and melancholy Turk,
she had cast it from her.  Her one instinct was to
hide her ugliness from every one.  Even at the
sight of John the Baptist she would fly and hide,
and she never left the house except after dark,
when for exercise she would sometimes race
Haidee up and down the <em class="italics">digue</em>, or run along the
beach at midnight, her scarf floating behind her in
the wind, and her head bare to give her "roots"
a chance.</p>
<p class="pnext">These proceedings gravely annoyed the Customs
officers distributed in the little straw-littered
watch-huts that line the Normandy coast.  Instead
of tucking themselves in their blankets for a
peaceful night, they were obliged to keep awake
for fear the mad American woman meant either to
commit suicide or meet a boat full of brandy and
cigars from Jersey.</p>

<p class="pfirst">From Jersey Val had made a bee-line for Paris
which she knew well, and where she had
hopes of renewing her mental energy by the sights
and sounds of a great city and association with
other brain workers.  Autumn removals were in
full swing and there was no great difficulty in
finding house-room for herself and the children,
though she was unprepared to find how Paris rents
had risen since the days when she and her mother
sojourned in the Latin Quarter.  It was to that
part of Paris she naturally turned--the only
possible part for artists and writers to live, though
the rich and empty-headed are fond of calling it the
"wrong side" of the river.  A studio seemed the
most suitable form of residence, for she knew she
would not be able to work in a small room, and she
hated the sordid construction of a cheap flat.  She
was fortunate in finding a good <em class="italics">atelier</em> in a little
secluded <em class="italics">rue</em> on the confines of the Quarter--a big,
high room, with kitchen and small bedroom
attached, looking out onto a little square yard with
clusters of shrubs, ivied walls, and a few old
battered statues that lent a picturesque air.  Here she
had settled down and with resolute energy begun
the series of "Wanderfoot" articles for which
Branker Preston had obtained a commission.  It
was an arduous task.  No matter how much
material is stored in the mind it is not easy to
import the air and colour of far-off lands into a
Paris <em class="italics">atelier</em>.  The art of putting things down had
not yet been recaptured either.  Still, the stimulus
of even the short journey from Jersey to Paris had
done something for her, and though to her critical
eye the articles she achieved seemed but pale echoes
of her former work, they at least paid the rent
and kept things going in rue Campagne Premiere.
The continuation of Haidee's education became a
problem needing instant attention; for Val very
soon realised that the Latin Quarter with its liberal
ideas of morality and its fascinating students was
no place for a young impressionable girl.  Her own
child she would have allowed to stay, for she knew
that anything with her nature would come to no
harm among these careless, attractive people, to
whom she felt herself blood-kin.  But Haidee, the
child of a pretty flighty mother, was of different
stock.  Besides, there was a responsibility to
Westenra in the matter.  There were no convents left
in Paris, or indeed, in France.  All those lovely
homes where girls learned a sweet sedateness and
many beautiful arts had been closed by a ruthless
government.  No more in France may the gentle
coifed women impart composure and beauty of
mind to English and American girls and train the
aristocratic children of France to a love of Church
and Country.  What the loss is to the sum of the
world's harmony can never be computed, but
American and English mothers have a slight
realisation of it.</p>
<p class="pnext">It was in Belgium that Val at last found what
was needed for Haidee--a little community of
French nuns who, refusing to unveil, had been
obliged to flee over the border, and there had
founded a convent to which many good Catholics
in Paris sent their children.  It was well within
Val's means too, for the living is cheap in Belgium,
and the fare in the convent was simple though
good.  Haidee hated terribly to go, but Val was
firm, though she held out the promise of early
liberation if Haidee would work well at French and
try and pass her <em class="italics">brevet simple</em>.  This was no difficult
task, for the girl had been well grounded in French
during their sojourn in Jersey.  Remained the
problem of Bran--and little children are a problem
in France to parents of limited means.  No one
caters for them as in other countries.  No one
even understands the art of teaching and amusing
them at the same time, nor even how to feed them.
There are no kindergartens and no milk puddings!
Small wonder that French babies are small and
sallow and sad!  Since the nuns were driven out
there are only the public Lycées where strong and
weak, rough and gentle, are jumbled together with
results that no thinking woman would welcome
for her child.  From their tenderest years French
children are crammed with lessons, pushed ahead
to pass exams, while the business of play so necessary
for little children is almost entirely suppressed.</p>
<p class="pnext">Val very certainly had no intention of confiding
her son to such institutions.  She was therefore
obliged to hire a daily governess for him, for
though, at his age, he needed little teaching, he
had to be sent out of doors so that she might have
silence and solitude wherein to work.  Even this
was a costly business.  In England a nursery
governess can be afforded by almost every one,
but in France it costs one hundred francs a month
to have your child well taken care of and taught
his alphabet for a few hours a day.</p>
<p class="pnext">Val did not grudge it, but what worried her was
that Bran did not thrive.  Paris was no place for
him.  The Luxembourg Gardens make a good
play-ground for city-bred children, but Bran was
Val's own child in his need of air and space and
horizon.  His bloom faded a little, and he began
to look very fair and spiritual.  Also his love of
the picture and statue galleries seemed to his
mother something too wistful and wonderful in a
small boy, and brought tears to her pillow in the
silence of many a night.  Then she took him to
Belgium for awhile and left him with Haidee and
the good nuns.  He was a shy creature, though
he hated any one to know it, and believed he hid
his secret well behind a set smile and little hardy
incomprehensible sayings.  When the nuns clustered
round him calling him their "little Jesus," a
favourite name in France for a pretty child, he
disdained to shelter behind Val's skirts, as instinct
bade him, but nothing could be got out of him
except an enigmatic saying he always kept for
strangers:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line">"The cat says bow-wow-wow, and</div>
<div class="line">The dog says meow, meow, meow."</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="pfirst">All the while he smiled his little bright smile and
his eyes roving keenly noted every detail of the
pale æsthetic faces.  Even the tears in the
Reverend Mother's eyes did not escape him.  Afterward
he said to Val:</p>
<p class="pnext">"I like that one with the floating eyes.  I think
she wishes she had a nice little boy like me.  Her
voice was littler than a pin's head when she called
me her <em class="italics">petit Jesu</em>.  But why do they nearly all
have green teeth?"</p>
<p class="pnext">When Val kissed him farewell it nearly broke
her heart to see the brave smile he maintained,
though Haidee was sniffling and snuffling at his
elbow, partly with momentary grief but mostly
with indignation at being, as she rudely phrased
it: "Shut up in a convent with a lot of old pussycats."</p>
<p class="pnext">Back in Paris the studio seemed desolate and
empty.  Bran had become so much a part of his
mother's being and life that without him she was
like a bird from whom a wing had been torn.  A
month later Haidee wrote:</p>
<p class="pnext">"I think Bran is fretting.  Whenever I speak
to him he puts that little fixed grin on his mouth,
but you should see his eyes."</p>
<p class="pnext">Within an hour Val was in the Brussels express
speeding for that dear sight.  On the journey
back to Paris, happy now and healed of her broken
wing, she heard all the history of his lonely nights
and the "purply-red pain" that he got in his
stomach when he thought of her.  Cuddled to her
side he wept as he had never wept whilst separated
from her, and Val's tears ran down her face too
while she listened, registering a vow that she would
never part with him again.</p>
<p class="pnext">So once more he went out with a governess and
came home to his mother full of original criticisms
of Moreau's pictures and the statues of Rodin,
until one morning nearly two years after their
arrival in Paris, and just when Haidee had arrived
for the summer holidays, Val rose up from her bed
with the itch for travel in her feet, and the longing
quickly communicated to the children for the sight
of a clear horizon.  They tore their possessions
from the walls, stuffed them into trunks, and shook
the dust of Paris from their feet.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Let's go to Italy and live on olives and
spaghetti, "was Haidee's suggestion, but Bran knew
the news of the world.</p>
<p class="pnext">"We might get an earthquake!"</p>
<p class="pnext">The size of the cheque from Branker Preston,
however, was what really decided the affair,
limiting them to wandering happily enough in Brittany.
But the water and primitive methods of Breton
cooks made Val think nervously of typhoid, and
after a time she headed for Normandy.  Normans
are cleaner in their household ways than Bretons,
of whom they slightingly speak as "<em class="italics">les pores
Bretons</em>," declaring that they eat out of holes in
the table and never wash the holes.  Besides,
Normandy in winter is milder than Brittany.  So,
travelling by highways and byways, they
happened at last on Mascaret.</p>
<p class="pnext">It was the tag end of September when they
arrived.  All the summer visitors were gone and the
big silver beach deserted, but summer itself still
lingered.  They got an entrancing glimpse of the
gentle green and gold beauty of the place before
the chills of autumn set in.  Even then they had
been able to bathe and go sailing in the fishing
boat of one of <em class="italics">père</em> Duval's sons, who was now in
his turn lighthouse-keeper of Mascaret.  For ten
sunny October days, too, they had assisted with
all the ardour of novitiates at <em class="italics">père</em> Duval's cider
making, becoming acquainted with the secrets
of <em class="italics">cidre bouché</em>, and the grades to be found in
<em class="italics">cidre ordinaire</em> unto the third and fourth watering.
They even sampled the latter as drunk by the
fishermen and called for at the cafés by the name
of <em class="italics">le boisson avec le brulot dedans</em>: which signifies
cider very liberally diluted with French cognac.
Then the winter closed in on Mascaret with wild
gales and high-flowing tides.  On Christmas Eve
snow came softly down, so that the walk to
midnight mass had been like acting in that scene
painted by a Dutch painter where the village folk
are seen winding their way through the snow,
lanterns and hot-water bottles in their hands, to the
distant church with windows full of red light.  All
the winter interests of the simple village had been
sampled and shared by Val and the children, and
they had been happier there than ever in France.
The children loved the freedom of the place and
the <em class="italics">bonhomie</em> of the French folk so different to
English people of that class.  The three went about
in their red sweaters and lived a life of absolute
unconvention.  It was a good place to write a
masterpiece in--if one were only a master--was
Val's ironical thought, and in spite of her
self-directed irony, she did achieve during the first
months there a wonderful little curtain raiser,
which Branker Preston had no difficulty in
disposing of to a London manager.  It dealt with
Boers and Zulus, and had been well received, but
unfortunately the play it had preceded in the bill
was a failure and the two were withdrawn together
before Val could greatly benefit, but it had brought
in five guineas a week for six weeks, and this
success had put her in heart for further work of the
kind.  She had sickened of writing "Wanderfoot"
articles from a chair.  She could by this time have
written some very spirited ones on the subject of
France in general and Normandy in particular,
but she had her reasons for not wishing to attract
attention to her whereabouts, as such articles
would surely have done.  Preston advised her to
write a novel, but she knew she had neither the
patience to spin a long story through many chapters
to its end, nor the gift of character portrayal.
What was hers was a sense for situation, colour,
and atmosphere, and it occurred to her that the
best vehicle for a display of these qualities was
the theatre.  Her first little venture had attracted
the attention of several managers, and one of them
told Preston that he was ready to consider a
three-act play by her.  It was this play she was busy
upon now.  But it was sometimes hard to
transport the atmosphere of far-away tropical Natal
into a little wooden villa facing the English
Channel, with a wild spring gale tearing at the windows,
and the rollers booming like cannon on the
Barleville beach--for the promise of summer had gone
as swiftly as it came, and the spring tides were
flooding up the river flinging great walls of spray
over the <em class="italics">digue</em> and splashing three feet deep across
the Terrasse, right to the steps of the <em class="italics">Hotel de la
Mer</em>, so that the journey to the village had to be
made by a path up the cliff.</p>
<p class="pnext">Val found that the only way to ignore Normandy
and the bleak mists of <em class="italics">La Manche</em> was to sit over
a <em class="italics">chaufferette</em> full of bright red embers of charcoal,
letting the heat steal up her skirts and enveloping
her whole person from the soles of her feet to her
scalp in a lovely glow.  Immediately she would
begin to write things full of the tropical languor
of Africa.  In her brain palms waved, little
pot-bellied Kaffirs rolled in the hot dirt, sunshine
blazed over a blue and green land, the air was
filled with the scent of mimosa, and great-limbed
Zulus danced in rhythmic lines with chant and
stamp and swing of assegai before Cetewayo, the
great and cruel king.</p>
<p class="pnext">Unfortunately, a <em class="italics">chaufferette</em> is not always an
easy thing to manage.  Like everything French
it has a temperament, and is liable to moods when
it will burn and moods when it won't.  It is a
wooden or tin box, perforated at the top and open
at one side to admit an earthenware bowl full of
the charcoal which is called <em class="italics">charbon de
bois</em>--actually calcined morsels of green wood.  The
baker makes this charbon by sticking green wood
branches into his hot oven after he has finished
baking his bread, but each baker makes a limited
supply only, and will not sell it except to people
who buy his bread.  Every one uses <em class="italics">chaufferette</em>
in Normandy during the winter, and visitors are
given one to put their feet on as soon as they enter
a house, though sometimes when the host is rich
enough to keep a perpetual fire going, a supply of
hot bricks is kept in the oven instead.</p>
<p class="pnext">Val's <em class="italics">chaufferette</em> was of most uncertain temper.
Hortense always lit it in the morning, and left it
by the writing-table.  When Val came to it all
that had to be done was to gently insert an old
spoon under the little ash heap and lift it all round,
when a red hot centre of glowing embers would
disclose itself.  But sometimes an old nail or piece
of "Carr-<em class="italics">diff</em>" found its way by accident into the
pot, then the charbon would immediately sulk
itself into oblivion, or sometimes for no reason at
all after being perfectly lighted it would just go
out.  Ensued a struggle in which Val and Haidee
invariably came off second-best.  They would take
the pot out of its box and stand it on a window-sill
with the window drawn low to make a draught;
put it on the front door step and, kneeling down,
blow on it until fine ash sat thick upon their noses
and their eyes were full of tears; build paper
bonfires on it; fan it wildly with newspapers.  All
to no avail!  Usually that was the end of work and
inspiration for the day.  Val declared that she
could not <em class="italics">think</em> with cold feet.  But sometimes
old <em class="italics">père</em> Duval, compassionate for the mad, would
send up his wooden box, large enough for two
men to warm their feet on, with a great iron
saucepan full of glowing charbon inside, and Val would
sit toasting over it and write things of a tropical
languor extraordinary.</p>
<p class="pnext">Haidee had passed her <em class="italics">brevet simple</em>, an exam,
about equal to the English Oxford Junior, and the
American 6th standard, and was now working for
the <em class="italics">brevet supérieure</em> with a French woman who
had been a governess before she married a retired
commercial traveller and settled in Mascaret.
The discovery of this good woman was a stroke
of luck for Val, though certainly Haidee did not
consider it so.  However, her lessons only took
up four hours a day.  For the rest she and Bran
idled joyous and care-free through life, climbing
the cliff, fishing, digging for sand-eels, making long
excursions inland, or meeting the fishing boats
in the evening when they came in with the day's
haul, and all the villagers would be at the <em class="italics">port</em>
to bargain for fish.  Haidee usually haggled for
and bought a <em class="italics">raie</em> (dog-fish) for the next day's
dinner, and Bran would run a stick through its
ribald-looking mouth, and carry the slithery
monstrous thing home, to be met by scowls from
Hortense, who, stolid as she was, hated the sight
of a <em class="italics">raie</em>, and could not face the business of
washing and gutting it without cries of <em class="italics">douleur</em> and
disgust.</p>
<p class="pnext">"<em class="italics">Ah!  C'est craintive!  C'est affreux!</em>"</p>
<p class="pnext">But meat was too dear for daily consumption,
and <em class="italics">raie</em> the only fish brought in by the boats
throughout the winter months, so it had to be
eaten, and some one had to prepare it.  And after
all, wrestling with <em class="italics">raie</em> was one of the jobs for which
Hortense was paid three francs a week.  It was
her business to come in the morning at seven
o'clock, make the fires, and deliver "little
breakfast" at each bedside; afterwards she swept and
made the beds, then disappeared until just before
lunch, when she came to perform upon the <em class="italics">raie</em>
and execute one or two culinary feats that were
beyond the scope of Val or Haidee--such as
cutting up onions, which neither of them could
accomplish without weeping aloud, or putting the
chipped potatoes into a pan full of boiling dripping,
a business that when conducted by Val made a
rain of grease spots all over the kitchen and scalded
every one in sight.  After washing the midday
dishes, and chopping up vegetables for the soup,
Hortense would consider her function over for the
day, and leave Val and Haidee to grapple as best
they might with tea, supper, fires, and the
<em class="italics">chaufferette</em>.  The supper was no very great difficulty,
merely a matter of putting the cut vegetables into
a pot with a large lump of specially prepared and
seasoned dripping, and standing said pot on the
stove until supper-time, when its contents would
be marvellously transformed into <em class="italics">soupe à la graise</em>,
a savoury and nourishing broth eaten as an
evening meal by every peasant in Normandy.  The
fires were the greatest nuisance.  The stove in the
kitchen either became a red-hot furnace and purred
like a man-eater, or else went out; and the stove
with an open grate in Val's room, which old man
Duval had paid a month's rent for and gone all the
way to Cherbourg to fetch, had a way of going out
also before any one even noticed that it was low;
then there would be much scratching with a
poker, searching for kindling wood, pouring out of
paraffin, sudden happy blazes that nearly took the
roof off, and black smuts everywhere.  When all
was over, and a beautiful fire roaring after the
united efforts of the family, Val would find that
her <em class="italics">chaufferette</em> had gone out!  It was hard to
even think masterpieces among such distractions,
to say nothing of writing them.  Tea was easily
got.  Haidee made the toast on the salad fork,
Val buttered it with dripping, Bran laid the table.
Then all three sat with their feet on the stove,
drinking out of the big coffee bowls, eating every
scrap of the delicious smoky toast and licking
their fingers afterwards.  If Val had written
anything funny or dramatic that day she would
sometimes read it out to them, but for the most
part her instinct was to hide what she wrote.
She said she felt as if she had lost something
afterwards, and if any one had been even looking at
her written sheets they never seemed quite the
same to her again--some virtue went out of her
work the moment she shared it with any one.</p>
<p class="pnext">Usually, after tea she settled down for another
struggle with her ideas, and Bran and Haidee went
for a prowl on the <em class="italics">digue</em> in the hope of adventures.
Bran, whose mind was as full of fairies as if he
had been born in the wilds of Ireland, was always
in hope of meeting a giant or a dwarf, but he had
learned not to mention these aspirations to Haidee.
Anyway, there was always the village gossip to
listen to in the <em class="italics">petit port</em>, where the fishing boats
anchored and usually the excitement of watching
the <em class="italics">Quatre Frères</em> come chup--chup--chupping
up the river to her moorings.  She was a natty
and picturesque trawler, with a petrol engine that
was the admiration of the village installed in her
bowels.  Because of this engine she was known as
the <em class="italics">Chalutier à petrole</em>, but at Villa Duval she
was called by Bran's translation of her name,
<em class="italics">The Cat's Frères</em>.  She never caught anything but
<em class="italics">raie</em>, and of this despised species far fewer than
any of the other boats, but she dashed in and out
of the harbour with great slam and needed five men
to handle her.  There was a legend that the petrol
engine frightened the fish away.  It was known
that the four brothers who owned her were anxious
to get rid of her.  Every one knew that she cost
more than she brought in.  But Haidee and Bran
shared a fugitive hope that Val's play would make
them all so rich that they would be able to acquire
her as a pleasure boat.</p>
<p class="pnext">Sometimes strange craft from Granville or a
Brittany port would come in for the night, and
there was the <em class="italics">St. Joseph</em>, a great fishing trawler
from Lannion, carrying a master and seven hands,
that put in when weather was heavy.  Her sails
were patched with every colour of the rainbow,
her decks were filthy, and her years sat heavy upon
her--you could hear her creaking and groaning
two miles from shore: but to Haidee and Bran she
stood for the true romance!  She always brought
in tons of fish, not only the everlasting <em class="italics">raie</em>, but
deep-sea fish, and as soon as her arrival was heralded
all the village sabots came clipper-clopping down
the terrace, shawls clutched round bosoms, the
wind flicking bright red spots in old cheeks, every
one anxious to pick and choose from the mass of
coal-fish, red gurnet, plaice, congers, and mullets
that was hooked out of the hold and flung quivering
ashore.  The big weather-beaten fishermen in
their sea-boots bandied jests with the carking old
village wives and the girls showered laughter.  In
the end, the villagers departed with full baskets,
and the seamen well content adjourned to the
<em class="italics">petit café</em> close by for a "cup of coffee with a burn
in it" and a good meal.</p>

</div>
<p class="pfirst">In May, the gentle month of May, the weather
cleared up again, and green things commenced
to sprout and bloom on the cliff above Villa Duval.
The country-side began to bloom and blossom as
the rose.  From the high coast that lies facing the
sea, Jersey could be discerned on clear days etched
as if in India ink upon the horizon thirteen miles
away.  Clots of sea-samphire burst into flower,
cleverly justifying its name of <em class="italics">creste marine</em> by
just keeping out of reach of the high tides.  The
gorse showed dots of yellow amongst its prickles,
and little brilliant blue squills stuck up their perky
faces and gave out a sweet scent.  All along the
path to the lighthouse wild thyme came out in
springy masses, and the mad Americans often
went up that way for the special purpose of lying
on it as on a soft, pink silk rug.  It seemed to cause
them a peculiar kind of joy to put their faces down
in it, crying, "Oh! oh! oh!"</p>
<p class="pnext">The garbage-hole across the road in front of
Villa Duval which the dustman had been trying
for many summers to transform into a building
plot by filling it with empty tins and rubbish from
the hotel, and which had been an eyesore all the
winter, now suddenly became a place of beauty,
for a lot of prickly, thistly-looking plants growing
among the jam tins burst into a blaze of red and
yellow.  It turned out that they were poppies that
had been keeping themselves secret all through the
winter, and the yellow bright gold of "Our Lady's
bedstraw."  One day Haidee brought home some
long, fragile trails of cinquefoil, one of the first
spring things, and Val, worn and haggard under her
blue veil, pinned it over her heart because she had
read in old Elizabethan days that cinquefoil was
supposed to be a cure for inflammations and fevers.
She quoted to Haidee what an old herbalist had
once written of such cures:</p>
<p class="pnext">"Let no man despise them because they are
plain and easy: the ways of God are all such."</p>
<p class="pnext">Haidee flushed faintly and retired into awkward
silence, shy like most girls of her age at the mention
of God.  She was going to make her communion
the next day with the First Communion candidates,
but it was not her first, for that had been made once
when she was ill in New York.  She was to be
confirmed in June when the archbishop of a neighbouring
parish intended to visit Mascaret and hold
a confirmation service.</p>
<p class="pnext">It being Saturday afternoon Hortense as well
as Haidee was due at the confessional for the recital
of her weekly sins, therefore she bustled over the
washing-up, announcing her intention of making a
<em class="italics">bon</em> confession, as though the one she usually made
was of an inferior brand.</p>
<p class="pnext">"What are you going to tell?" asked Haidee,
drying plates.  She knew very well it was forbidden
to talk about your confession, but the subject
was a curiously fascinating one.  Hortense had a
"cupful of sins" for the curé's ear.  She had been
reading love stories in the <em class="italics">Petit Journal</em> (a
forbidden paper because it is "against the Church"),
telling the cards, and consulting her dream book;
also she had missed Vespers twice and several
meetings of the "Children of Mary," of which body
she was a member.  She computed that her
<em class="italics">pénitence</em> would be as long as her arm.</p>
<p class="pnext">"He will scold me well, I know," she said
cheerfully, "for he saw me talking with Léon Bourget
yesterday."</p>
<p class="pnext">"What! that awful fisherman with the hump?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Yes; but he is not a bad fellow, mademoiselle,
only all the fishermen here are wicked towards the
curé because, as you know, he would not bury the
mother of Jean le Petit, and they had to go and
get the mayor to do it."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Yes; but you must remember that she lived
with old man le Petit without being married to
him, and that is forbidden by the Church.  She
would not even repent on her death-bed and
receive the Blessed Sacrament.  How could the
curé bury her after that?"</p>
<p class="pnext">Haidee knew all about the little scandal, for
the storm it occasioned had raged all the winter
about the curé's head.  The same day he had
refused to bury <em class="italics">mère</em> le Petit he was obliged to go
to Paris on Church business.  On his return in the
dusk of a December evening he was met at the
station by all the fishermen in the village partially
disguised in home-made masks, each carrying some
instrument or implement with which to make
hideous sounds; pots, pans, old trays, sheep-bells,
and cow-horns had all been pressed into service,
and the din was truly fearsome.  The curé
preserving his serenity was conducted to his
presbytery by this scratch band, and on every dark night
thereafter it had serenaded him from the shadows
near his house.  The blare sometimes continued
until the small hours of the morning, keeping not
only the unfortunate curé, but the whole village
awake.  The gendarmes from Barleville, the
nearest police-station, had made several midnight
raids with the stated intention of capturing the
offenders, but their efforts were attended by a
lack of success so striking as to suggest a certain
amount of sympathy, not to say complicity, on the
part of the law.  At any rate, the curé's music, or
"<em class="italics">Mujik de Churie</em>," as it was popularly pronounced,
went on gaily, and there had been some kind of
unofficial announcement that it would continue
until the curé cleared out.  Old <em class="italics">pére</em> Duval opined,
however, that the entertainment was likely to cease
with the arrival of the first summer visitors, for
however vindictive the fishermen were they knew
which side their bread was buttered on, and were
politic enough not to want to drive away trade by
their thrilling "mujik."</p>
<p class="pnext">Having finished drying plates Haidee retired
up-stairs to prepare her confession, telling
Hortense to be sure and wait for her.  She proceeded
to write her sins down on a piece of paper.  In
spite of her good French she stammered so much
from nervousness when confessing that the curé
had arranged this method with her.  She always
gave him the piece of paper, which he took away
to the sacristy while she waited in the confessional.
When he had read her paper he came back, conferred
penance and a little scolding, then gave her
absolution.</p>
<p class="pnext">With the aid of a French Catechism, which had
a formula for confession in it, she proceeded to
write out her sins, her method being to dive into
the book first for a question and then into her
soul for a sin that corresponded.  Eventually the
piece of paper contained the following statement:</p>
<p class="pnext">"Je ne me suis pas confessé depuis trois semaines;
j'ai recu l'absolution.  Je m'accuse:</p>
<p class="pnext">"De n'avoir pas fait ma priere du matin
beaucoup de fois.</p>
<p class="pnext">"De n'avoir pas fait ma prière du soir plusieurs fois.</p>
<p class="pnext">"D'avoir manqué aux Vêpres 4 fois.</p>
<p class="pnext">"D'avoir été distraite dans l'Église 2 fois.</p>
<p class="pnext">"D'avoir été dissipée dans l'Église 2 fois.</p>
<p class="pnext">"D'avoir désobéi à ma mère 2 fois.</p>
<p class="pnext">"D'avoir manqué de respect envers elle 1 fois.</p>
<p class="pnext">"De m'été disputée avec mon frère 2 fois.</p>
<p class="pnext">"D'avoir fait des petits mensonges 4 fois.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Je m'accuse de tous ces pèches et de ceux dont
je ne me souviens pas.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Je demande pardon de Dieu et à vous, mon
père, la pénitence et l'absolution selon que vous
m'en jugerez digne."</p>
<p class="pnext">Whether this list of offences truly represented
the burden of her transgressions for the past three
weeks it would be hard to say.  It is possible that
Val could have made out a longer and more
comprehensive one for her, as she often threatened to
do when Haidee vexed her.  Anyway, the latter
folded up her piece of paper with a complacency
that either betokened a clear conscience or a heart
hardened in crime.  She computed that her
penance would be to recite a decade of the rosary,
and she knew that the curé would then speak of the
next Church feast, and of the wishes preferred by
the Sacred Heart and the Blessed Virgin, tell her
to invoke the aid of the Saints when she felt
herself tempted to sin, to try always to give a good
example to her little brother, and to be very pious
so that her mother would be converted and become
a Catholic.  Both Val and Haidee had long since
given up explaining that they were not mother and
daughter.  They found that it saved time and a lot
of questions just to let people think what they liked.</p>
<p class="pnext">Putting on her hat Haidee now popped her head
out of the window and gave a hoot to Hortense,
who was below in the yard cleaning her boots on
the garden seat.  Just as they were about to start
Val came down-stairs and begged Haidee to go to
the butcher's shop on her way back, and bring
home something for Sunday's dinner.</p>
<p class="pnext">"What kind of something?" asked Haidee
belligerently, for the butcher's shop had no allure
for her.  There ensued a discussion as to which was
the most economical meat to get.  Hortense,
waiting at the bottom of the steps, piped in with
the announcement that every one ought to eat
lamb on First Communion Sunday.  Val and
Haidee looked at each other.  Vaguely they knew
that the price of lamb was high.  But suddenly
it came into Val's mind how sick the children must
be of <em class="italics">raie</em>, and stewed veal, and that though funds
were low the play was nearly finished.  They would
have a nice English dinner for once.  Roast lamb
and mint sauce!  She gave Haidee her last <em class="italics">louis</em>
to change.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Pick some mint from the cliff-side as you come
back," she enjoined.  French peasants have no use
for mint in their cooking.  Some English visitors
had once planted a root of it in <em class="italics">pére</em> Duval's
garden, but after they were gone he flung it out
again on to the cliff-side, where it had increased
and multiplied until it was now a large bed.</p>
<p class="pnext">In the butcher's shop Haidee found a number of
villagers squabbling over beef-bones, and not a
sign of lamb anywhere.  The truth was that every
portion of the one lamb killed early in the week had
been sold, and though there were still one or two
customers in need of First Communion lamb,
Mother Durand knew better than to offer any of
the freshly-killed beast that hung in the back shed.
Peasants are well aware that freshly-killed meat
should not be cut too early or it will be full of air,
soft, flabby, and never tender.  Mother Durand,
under her calm exterior, was furiously angry with
her man for having delayed the killing until
now--after to-day there would be no demand for
anything but beef-bones and veal until the summer
visitors began to arrive.  The young American
mademoiselle asking guilelessly for lamb was a
godsend.  Waiting until the last villager had gone
from the shop so that there would be no adverse
comment on what she meant to do, she turned
ingratiatingly to Haidee.</p>
<p class="pnext">"But certainly, mademoiselle ... there is
none in the shop ... but outside I have a lamb
that is <em class="italics">superbe</em> ... just the thing for a <em class="italics">première
communion</em> ... it is not for every one I would
cut that lamb, but for such customers as you and
your <em class="italics">belle maman</em> there is nothing I would not
do."  She returned presently from the back shed.
"There, mademoiselle--a beautiful shoulder.  Six
francs."</p>
<p class="pnext">Haidee was horrified at the price.  Their dinner
meat usually cost about one franc twenty, and
she knew that there was much to be accomplished
with Val's last twenty-franc piece.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Could n't you give me a smaller one, Madame
Durand? ... and not so dear?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Ah, mademoiselle, you should have said to me
before that you wanted it small.  It is cut now
... and what would I do with the pieces from
it?  Do you think I could sell them?  But no."</p>
<p class="pnext">So Haidee took the shoulder, and returned
home with it tucked under her arm.  On arrival
as it happened old <em class="italics">veuve</em> Michel was in the kitchen
with Val, having just brought home some odds and
ends of family washing.</p>
<p class="pnext">"What!" she cried, on seeing the lamb.  "A
shoulder of freshly-killed lamb, full of air and
bubbles ... cut off the poor nice lamb while it
had yet the hot life in it!  Shame on the wretched
woman Durand ... to take advantage thus of
poor innocent Americans! ... Shame!  But
then every one knows how she treated her poor
daughter who wanted to be a nun.  Madame, the
stones in the street are not more wicked than that
woman Amélie Durand!"</p>
<p class="pnext">Val, much disturbed by these sayings, examined
the shoulder of mutton.  Certainly it was very
bubbly looking: warm too.  She remembered now
hearing the cook in New York storm over a piece
of freshly-killed meat, declaring that it had been
cut too soon and was not fit to eat.</p>
<p class="pnext">"How ought I to cook it to make the best of it?"
she inquired in dismay.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Cook it!" cried Widow Michel, scarlet in the
face from indignation combined with the effects
of her afternoon bottle of cognac.  "No good to
cook it.  Better to pluck a rock from the cliff-side
and cook it."</p>
<p class="pnext">"How much was it, Haidee?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Six francs."</p>
<p class="pnext">"<em class="italics">Mon Dieu</em>!  What imposition!  Take it back,
Haidee dear, and tell her that it is too dear and
too fresh ...  she must give us a pound of steak
instead.  We are too poor to buy meat we can't
eat, you know, darling.  Six francs!  Did you pay
for it?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Why, yes, of course I paid for it.  You know
I had the <em class="italics">louis</em>.  Oh! blow Val, I don't care much
about taking it back."</p>
<p class="pnext">"But, Haidee, what's the use of talking like
that ... we can't eat that bubbly lamb
... think of poor Brannie without dinner!  I 'd go
myself if I had any hair....  Tell her it 's
ridiculous to have given you such meat.  I remember
now Hortense said that leg we had at Christmas
and could n't eat was too freshly-killed--it was
soft and tough at the same time, and all slithery
when you tried to cut it.  Don't you remember--it
made you sick to look at it?"</p>
<p class="pnext">Yes, Haidee remembered well enough, but she
did n't like taking the shoulder back just the same.
However, <em class="italics">veuve</em> Michel offered the moral support
of her company, and she returned to Mother
Durand.  Half-an-hour later she was back at the
Villa, the wretched shoulder of lamb still in her
hands.</p>
<p class="pnext">"She won't take it back.  She says it 's a rule
of the shop never to take back meat that has once
gone out of it."</p>
<p class="pnext">"But it was back within half-an-hour."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Yes, I told her so--and you should have heard
old <em class="italics">veuve</em> Michel going on at her, but she did n't
care two sous.  She said, 'Oh, yes, mademoiselle,
carrying my lamb up and down the Terrasse in the
hot sun--you think that improves the meat.  Hein?
Well, I don't think so.  <em class="italics">Dame</em>, no!"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Hot sun!  I wish it were hot!  They don't
know what sun is in this odious climate," cried
Val in wrath.</p>
<p class="pnext">"I know--but she won't take it back."  Haidee
flung the shoulder despondently upon the table.
But Val's monkey was up, and she was determined
not to be outdone by the cunning little Norman
woman.  Also it seemed to her by now that if
she offered the children that shoulder of lamb
she would be offering them poisoned meat.  She
hated it.  She would rather have eaten sea-sand.
With trembling hands she arranged across her
forehead the <em class="italics">chi-chi</em> that M. Poiret had made for
her out of her own hair (the first time she had
availed herself of it), put on a deep hat, tied a
motor veil over all, then with Bran held by one
hand and the shoulder of lamb in the other she set
out to do battle with Mother Durand.  Haidee,
though sick of the subject, accompanied the
expedition out of curiosity.</p>
<p class="pnext">The little red-cheeked, hard-eyed woman--a
typical shrewd Normandy peasant--was alone
in the shop, tidying up her lard-bowls with a large
flat knife.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Madame Durand!" said Val, controlling her
voice as best she could.  "About this shoulder of
lamb....?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Yes, madame!  What about it?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"You must take it back ... I do not care
for freshly-killed meat...."  She began to
stumble with her French.  "Not good for the
stomach .... very hard ... wicked ... no
good .... il faut give me back my six francs."</p>
<p class="pnext">"But not at all, madame ... the meat is
good ... <em class="italics">superbe</em> ... there is nothing the
matter with it.  I asked mademoiselle if she was
willing I should cut from the freshly-killed lamb,
and she said yes....  <em class="italics">Alors?</em>"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Oh!  How can you say so, Madame Durand?"
cried Haidee indignantly.  "I had no idea you
were cutting it from a lamb all hot."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Mademoiselle finds it very convenient to say
that now ... <em class="italics">très commode</em>!  But my husband
and daughter were in the shop, and heard
mademoiselle ask to have it cut from the lamb."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Oh, Val!  don't you believe it ... the old
liar!"  Haidee did not pick her words when
indignant.</p>
<p class="pnext">"In any case I will not have it back ... you
can take it or leave it, madame," the old woman
smiled the smile of one who plays a winning game.</p>
<p class="pnext">"I will leave it then," said Val, losing all
calmness.  "<em class="italics">Vous est pas juste ... vous est
mal honnête ... voleur</em>!  It is because we are
strangers that you take advantage of us ...it
is the first time I have found such <em class="italics">méchanterie</em>
in this village....  If you will not give me
back my money you can keep it and the meat
too!"  She flung it down and raged from the shop.</p>
<p class="pnext">"<em class="italics">Comme wus voudrez, madame</em>," responded
Mother Durand, only too delighted with such a
plan, and to see the backs of the departing trio.
But two minutes later, just as she was removing the
paper covering from the offending shoulder, Val
returned.  Stretching her firm, thin hand across
the counter she gripped the meat once more.</p>
<p class="pnext">"No!  I won't let you keep it to sell again.
Rather will I take it and give it to the first dog
I meet!"</p>
<p class="pnext">"As you please, madame," repeated Mother
Durand blandly, not to be nonplussed, whatever
might be her feelings.</p>
<p class="pnext">Val stalked from the shop, the shoulder now
devoid of wrappings in her hand.  Haidee and
Bran, sympathetic but apprehensive, waited without.</p>
<p class="pnext">"She shall not have it.  Find a dog, Haidee."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Oh, Val!  What's the good? ... keep it
... it will be better than nothing for dinner
to-morrow."</p>
<p class="pnext">"I would rather eat mud," said Val, white to
the lips.  "Find a dog."</p>
<p class="pnext">But there was no dog in sight.  They marched
down the road, a silent band, looking to right and
left for something canine.  Usually the village
was thick with hungry mongrels, but to-day it was
as though the earth had opened to receive all
flesh-eating quadrupeds.  Not even a cat showed
its face.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Perhaps a giant"--murmured Bran.  Haidee
was congratulating herself that they would get
home without further adventure, or that at least
Val's fury would presently abate enough for her
to abandon her idea, when, just in front of the
Café Rosetta a lean liver-and-white pointer with
the legs of a bull dog and the ears of a cocker
spaniel strolled out.  Val held the shoulder towards
him.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Here, boy, here--a good supper for you!"</p>
<p class="pnext">The "boy" regarded her suspiciously for a
moment, then came forward a step.  She
encouraged him with a kind word, and held the
meat nearer, but, suspecting a trick, he backed
growling.  He had never seen a shoulder of lamb
before except in a dream, and did not recognise the
pink-and-white thing.  He only recognised that
they were strangers--probably knew them to be
the mad Americans from Villa Duval.  At any
rate, after one long sniff he turned and walked
sadly away.  Val in a fury threw the lamb after
him, but he never turned.  Mournfully he slunk
down the slope of the <em class="italics">petit port</em> to seek the garbage
heaps in the river bed.  As the three stood staring
after him a little red-faced <em class="italics">bonne</em> came running
out of the café.</p>
<p class="pnext">"<em class="italics">Qu'est ce qu'il y a, madame?</em>" she cried.  Val
pointed to the meat lying in the dust.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Take that and give it to a dog."</p>
<p class="pnext">"But yes, madame; thank you, madame."</p>
<p class="pnext">Smiling all over, she picked up the meat and dusted
it carefully.  They saw very well she did not mean
to give it to a dog.</p>
<p class="pnext">"It is not fit for human food," stammered Val,
still shaking.</p>
<p class="pnext">"But no, madame; thank you, madame."</p>
<p class="pnext">She smiled and looked at it with fond eyes.  Val
could have struck her.  On the <em class="italics">Terrasse</em> Haidee said:</p>
<p class="pnext">"Val, how could you?  It will be all over the
town.  Even the curé will know."</p>
<p class="pnext">Val did not answer.  Her rage expended, she
was wondering what her Brannie was going to have
for dinner the next day.  Two great tears stole
down her face.</p>
<p class="pnext">When Haidee came back from eight o'clock Mass
the next morning she noticed many of the villagers
standing about in groups.  They were evidently
discussing some affair of great interest, but their
grave and serious voices subsided into whispers
at the sight of her, and while she passed a dead
silence prevailed in each group.  However, in
front of Lemonier's shop an old beldame lifted
her voice in the manner of a prophetess and gave
forth the dark saying that "it was to be hoped that
people who threw good meat to dogs would never
live to feel the pangs of hunger!"</p>
<p class="pnext">Haidee repeated this at home as a great joke,
but was sorry she did, for Val turned pale as a
condemned criminal, and her eyes searched the
faces of both children as if for the outward signs
of an inward gnawing at their vitals--but so far
both looked plump and composed.</p>
<p class="pnext">She spent the whole morning juggling with six
eggs and a pint of milk, the result being an
exceedingly wobbly-looking baked custard which
appeared to supplement the meagre midday repast.
At the sight of it Bran nearly lost his appetite for
the potatoes baked in their jackets which his soul
loved, and when pudding-time came he began to
squirm and declare he was not hungry.  With the
name of Bran he appeared to have also inherited
that great king's primitive tastes in food, for he
cared for nothing except milk, oatmeal porridge,
and potatoes with butter.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Do eat some, Brannie," pleaded the pale and
guilty Val.  "I made it specially for you.  It is
lovely."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Yes, I can see it is lovely," said Brannie,
politely, edging away from the table.  "But it
smells like a pussy cat just after she has been
drinking milk."</p>
<p class="pnext">When Hortense arrived to wash up she reported
that the two brothers of the <em class="italics">bonne</em> at the Café
Rosetta were in the village, having been
summoned from Cherbourg by telegraph to come and
lunch with their sister on a shoulder of Première
Communion lamb.</p>
<div class="center transition">
<p class="pfirst">――――</p>
</div>
<p class="pfirst">The confirmation ceremony was most grand.
It was the first time so important a personage as
an Archbishop had visited Mascaret, and the
villagers, sensible of the honour done them, were
inclined to forgive the curé his imagined misdeeds
for having arranged it.  Not only were all the
Premier Communion candidates from other
villages present, but a great many of the summer
visitors had arrived, and it was an enormous
congregation that waited in the stuffy church.  The
Archbishop's train was late, but at last he came
from the sacristy very crumpled and tired-looking
in his gold and purple robes, and walking with
faltering feet, for his years were heavy on him and
he was weary with travelling.  Everything about
him seemed old, from the rich lace on his aube
to his gentle blue eyes, which looked as though they
saw visions of far-off places--everything but the
small and wonderful white teeth in his sunken
gentle mouth.  His stole was beautifully painted
with lilies, and his mitre of shining white and gold
most splendid, but sometimes during the long
service his head drooped a little under it and rested
on his breast.  There was such a weariness about
him that Val was glad when she heard a few months
later that he had laid aside his heavy and elaborate
gold and white panoply of office and gone to rest.
He had about twelve priests with him, keen,
able-looking men, of a very different type to the simple
curés who were herding their flocks from the
surrounding villages, and they clustered about him as
though to keep the eyes of the world from resting
too long upon this venerable representative of the
Pope.  The <em class="italics">Vicaire-Général</em>, a splendid looking
man with an eagle eye and a strong beaked nose,
surveyed the church as a general might the field
of battle, while the congregation chanted the
Benedictus Dominus.  It seemed to Val that when
his eye rested on her he saw deep down into her
heart and had no pity for her failures, being of the
Napoleonic brand of man who has no use for any
but the strong ones of earth.</p>
<p class="pnext">After the Archbishop with crumpled crooked
fingers had given his solemn benediction to the
people, singing in a trembling yet wonderfully
thrilling old voice,</p>
<blockquote>
<div>
<p class="pfirst">"Sit nomen benedictum ... Adjutorium Domini
... Benedicat vos omnipotens Deus Pater et
Filius et Spiritus Sanctus,"</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="pfirst">he sat down just inside the chancel rails, and
talkingly questioned the children on their catechism.
Most of them were too shy to distinguish themselves
much, though the son of the village milkman,
an ugly cross-eyed boy, acquitted himself
manfully.  Later the Archbishop rested in his chair,
his chin on his breast, seeming to sleep, while
priests prowled and hovered round him.  The
Mascaret curé darted about the church giving
instructions, and presently the children broke
shrilly into the popular hymn:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line">"Je suis chrétien, voilà ma gloire,</div>
<div class="inner line-block">
<div class="line">Mon espérance et mon soutien,</div>
</div>
<div class="line">Mon chant d'amour et de victoire,</div>
<div class="inner line-block">
<div class="line">Je suis chrétien!  Je suis chrétien!"</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="pfirst">The village boys loved this hymn.  It lent
itself to much lusty shouting in the last two lines
of the chorus, and they delighted in it, passing
winks to each other as they hurled it from their
lungs with something of the same ardour as had
served for the "<em class="italics">mujik de churie</em>."  But later when
they filed in long lines to where the old Archbishop
sat waiting for them, their mien changed.  No one
could be vicious or violent before that beautiful
tired presence waiting with white trembling hands
to bless them.  They came quietly, one by one,
and knelt on the velvet cushion at his feet, the
boys bashful and cloddish in their best smocks,
the girls wearing the elaborate and top-heavy mob
cap of silk and muslins and ribbons that it is the
Normandy peasant woman's pride to perch above
her harsh features.  Haidee, in a white hemstitched
muslin frock with a flounce of delicate lace round
its edge, walked among them like some woodland
sylph escaped from a Corot picture.  Her long legs
clad in white silk stockings and sandals created
something of a scandal amongst the peasant
mothers, whose ideas of decency bid them cover
up the legs of their girls with the longest and
heaviest skirts they can afford.  Her headgear,
too, was considered characteristic of the madness
with which God had afflicted the occupants of
Villa Duval, for it was a tulle veil bound about her
brow by a wreath of real daisies, gathered and
twined by Val and Bran.</p>
<p class="pnext">Each child carried a tiny slip of paper on which
was written the new name which must be assumed
at confirmation as in baptism.  This paper was
handed to a priest who stood on the left of the
Archbishop and who, glancing swiftly at it,
transposed it into Latin and murmured it into the great
prelate's ear.  Haidee, who had chosen Joan, was
astonished to hear the Archbishop thus address her:</p>
<p class="pnext">"Joanna!  I mark thee with the sign of the
Cross, and I confirm thee <em class="italics">par le chrême du salut</em>, in
the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy
Ghost."  Then he gave her a little tap on the left
cheek and held out his ring to her; she kissed it
fervently and went away uplifted.  In passing
back a priest on the right stopped her and wiped
away the holy chrism (composed of balm and oil)
with a piece of cotton wool, which he let fall into
a basket held by a choir boy whose blue eyes
vaguely disturbed Haidee's saintly dream.  A
little farther on another priest intercepted her and
wiped her forehead once more, none too gently
she thought, with a rather dissipated-looking
napkin.  The cowboy look came over her face
at that, and Val reflected that it was just as well
there were no more priests to waylay her before
she reached her seat, for that Wild-West scowl was
often followed by acts which made up in vigour for
what they lacked in dignity.</p>
<p class="pnext">Val was not able to see the end of the ceremony,
for just as the priests closed in on the Archbishop,
one with a gilt bowl, another with soap and
broidered towel, another to take his ring, Bran
whispered to her in a panting whisper:</p>
<p class="pnext">"Mammie!  I 've got the gasps!"</p>
<p class="pnext">There was nothing for it but retreat to the
churchyard, for when Bran got "the gasps" the
only cure for them was air and solitude.  It was
a nervous affliction which often seized him when he
was deeply bored or, curiously enough, when he
was intensely excited, making him gasp like a
chicken with the pip, and Val would feel her heart
come into her throat with every opening of his
little beak.  While he regained his breathing
powers in the churchyard, she sat on a stone
watching him, thinking how she would have liked the
hands of the Archbishop on his precious head too.
There was surely some special benediction in such
delicate old hands; and though she asked no
blessings for herself, she wanted them all for
Garrett Westenra's son.  And while she sat there
musing, out of the sacristy door came the
Archbishop himself.  He, too, seemed afflicted with
gasps, for his mouth opened and closed and his
breath came in little pants.  None of his priests
were with him, only the village curé escorting him
to the presbytery, and he seemed somewhat like
a child escaped for a moment from his nurses.
When he saw Bran's smiling face his own lit up
and its weariness was for an instant wiped away.</p>
<p class="pnext">"A little American Catholic," said the curé,
but the old prelate had not waited for an
introduction before making the sign of the Cross over
Bran's bright head.  Val knelt in the dust while
the faltering feet passed by.  She felt as though
a star had fallen from heaven for her.</p>

<p class="pfirst">"Did you see the people from Villa Shai-poo?"
asked Haidee, as they walked home.</p>
<p class="pnext">"No, which were they?"  Val was away in a
land of her own peopling and her eyes were vague.</p>
<p class="pnext">"An awfully distinguished old man, with a little
white goatee and nice American-looking boots;
and two boys...."  She stopped abruptly.
Val's attention was attracted.</p>
<p class="pnext">"What kind of boys?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Oh, well!  I didn't notice them much.  You
know all French boys look as if they wear stays.
I dare say these are n't so bad though.  Hortense
says the eldest is in a regiment <em class="italics">très chic</em>.  The
other one failed for the navy last year."  Her
manner was meant to suggest pointed indifference.</p>
<p class="pnext">"They must be more than boys."</p>
<p class="pnext">"The one with the greeny-blue eyes is twenty-four
and the one with dark blue ones is nineteen
and a half," responded Haidee.  Val smiled at
this artless testimony of her "indifference."</p>
<p class="pnext">They were passing Shai-poo at the moment;
a big, square, roomy-looking house, with those solid
grey walls that stand for centuries and are so
typical of Normandy, surrounded by a spacious
garden full of the charm of careless grace--groups
of trees, flowering grasses, little forests of tall
bamboos, beds of brilliant flowers that looked as
if they had sprung up by happy accident, winding
paths, and a tea-house in the form of a Chinese
pagoda.  A great mainmast rooted from the
bowels of a French war-ship of old type was erected
in a clear open space that lay almost like a deck
around it.  From its top lazily floated a silk flag
embroidered with the Chinese Royal arms.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Their grandfather the Admiral must have
arrived," said Haidee excitedly.  "They only
put up that flag for him--it is the one he took in
the battle of Shai-poo.  That is the mast of his
old ship."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Goodness, Haidee! what a lot you know about
them!  Who is the man with the goatee and the
American boots then?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Oh, that's the father of Sacha, the one in the
army.  The other boy, Rupert, is a cousin and an
orphan."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Oh!"  Val pondered these things in her heart.
It was plain that Haidee was growing up, and
beginning to take an interest in other things than
hens and rabbits!  Evidently too she had been
listening to Hortense's gossip.  Val felt guilty
somehow, and wished wistfully that poor Haidee
could have the society and companionship of a
girl of her own age and world.</p>
<p class="pnext">When they got home they found that John the
Baptist had left some letters.  One of them was
from Harriott Kesteven, asking if Val would mind
very much if she came to Mascaret for the summer
months, bringing her girl Kitty.  It seemed almost
like an answer to Val's wish for society for Haidee.</p>
<p class="pnext">Her only doubt was as to Westenra.  Would
this, even though he never knew or cared, be
treachery to him--a last fire made of the blackened
embers of a burnt boat?</p>
<p class="pnext">It could scarcely be that after all!  He had been
at great pains these last few years to show her by
his silence and coldness how little her doings
mattered to him.  Apparently on his return to
America after the fatal visit to Jersey he had flung
himself into work with the result that sometimes
occurs in the lives of men; a temple of public
success had begun to raise its walls above the
grave of his private sorrows.  International
journals frequently mentioned his name in connection
with some wonderful operation performed at his
now famous nursing home.  Under the ægis of
the skilful Miss Holland the house in 68th Street
had become something very like a gold mine, as
the size of the quarterly cheques (which Val never
used) gave proof.  Of more importance was the
fact that he had advanced with great strides in
his scientific work, and the results of his
experimental investigations in diabetes were the talk
of medical Europe.  There were rumours of his
nomination for the next Nobel.</p>
<p class="pnext">Small wonder if in this furious concentration on
work and the fame it brought him, personal
emotion as far as Val was concerned should be crushed
out of his life like a useless, hurtful thing.  That at
last was the impression she gained from his letters
to Haidee, conned and brooded over in the silence
of the night when the children slept.  True, love
for Haidee and his son breathed from every line,
but there was never a word in the cold courteous
messages to Val that she could lay upon her heart
to heal its aching wound.  Time and distance had
widened the breach between them until now it was
a gaping ravine over which the correspondence
with Haidee formed the last frail bridge.  He had
never put foot in Europe since the visit to Jersey,
but taken all his vacations in different parts of
America.  Sometimes he wrote vaguely of coming
over to see them all, but Val felt herself left
outside his world now, and doubted that he seriously
considered making a movement that would bring
him back into hers.  It seemed almost ironical to
be wondering whether she would have his approval
or not in allowing Harriott Kesteven to come to
Mascaret.  It was so patent that he had long since
taken advantage of the circumstance that freed
his life from hers.</p>
<p class="pnext">She decided in the end that with a clear
conscience she might wire to London the word "come."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Of course I know there is a hotel in the place,
Val," Mrs. Kesteven had written, "but we'd
much rather come and picnic and be insane with
you on the Dutch-treat plan, each paying our own
share.  Do let us."</p>
<p class="pnext">And Val, though she knew her friend had two
thousand a year, and was used to every comfort
of modern civilisation, felt no hesitation about
bidding her welcome.  Harriott Kesteven was a
woman after her own heart; one who could make
herself just as much at home in the little wooden
cabins of Villa Duval as in her luxurious London
flat; who would rather tramp the desert with the
friend of her heart than be borne in the silken
litters of a stranger's caravan.</p>
<p class="pnext">To herself Val could not disguise what a joy it
would be to see Harriott again; to show her
Bran--the one tangible treasure snatched from the
grudging hand of Fate; to open her heart a little
to eyes that were lovingly tolerant, and would
smile rather than condemn.  Friendship should
be always such a joy: clear water in sight of a
thirsty soul--a tree under which to rest after long
travel!</p>
<p class="pnext">Harriott having speedily wired back that she
and her girl were starting at once, via Southampton
and Jersey, preparations for their advent set
in at Villa Duval.  They were not very complicated
preparations, however, merely a matter of clearing
out the two spare cabins, and storing the boxes
and baggage in one of <em class="italics">pére</em> Duval's lofts.  Then a
great gathering of wild flowers to stand in jam
jars all over the house and a hunting expedition
to the village for a <em class="italics">bonne-à-tout-faire</em>.  A
middle-aged stony-faced shrew bearing the poetical name
of Azalie was captured, and a bargain struck with
her to come in from seven in the morning till
seven in the evening, for the sum of ten francs
fifty a week, bread, coffee, and cider thrown in.
Hortense was to act as her <em class="italics">aide-de-camp</em>.</p>
<p class="pnext">Then on one afternoon the band of three went
across to the <em class="italics">digue</em> not more than five hundred
yards from their door, to meet the steamer from
Jersey.  It was the first boat of the year, and its
arrival quite the event of the season, so all the
world of Mascaret was leaning on the ropes put
up by the Customs' officers to prevent passengers
escaping before declaring themselves innocent of
contraband.  Val, with her <em class="italics">chi-chi</em> tied across her
forehead, her face swathed in veils, stood biting
her lips and trembling with emotion, nervous as a
bird at the thought of seeing her friend again.
She wondered fearfully if Harriott would find her
greatly changed.  Haidee, full of curiosity, was
scowling under her brigand hat ready to get out all
her porcupine-prickles if she did not like the other
girl on sight.  Bran pranced with excitement at
the thought of seeing a big ship once more.  Near
by were standing the two young men from the
Villa Shai-poo, and from behind her veils Val took
stock of them and found them goodly to look upon.
She liked their loose blue flannel suits, so different
from the usual tight correct clothes worn by young
Frenchmen at the seaside.  She liked their clear
skins and eyes too, and their sleek black heads.
In fact, they were not very French-looking at all,
but much more like Irish boys.  The younger one
especially, with his misty violet eyes and rather
dreamy face, might easily have been mistaken for
a west-of-Ireland lad.  The elder and handsomer
of the two possessed already the Frenchman's
hardy eye for a woman, and Val intercepted several
appraising glances cast in the direction of Haidee.
The younger fellow contented himself with smiling
at Bran, who smiled back in friendly fashion.</p>
<p class="pnext">"I like that boy," he confided to Val, "he's got a
hole 'n his chin and his hair is jet black."  Bran
decided all his likes and dislikes by colour and
smell.  His favourite colours were yellow, red, green, and
wet-black.  This last was very different to ordinary
black, which was the colour of toothache.  Little
rheumatic pains which he sometimes got in his
knees were grey.  The worst pain you could get
was a purply-red one which came when you were
sad and gave you the stomach-ache.  He had
once solemnly stated that the only colour he hated
was yellowy-pink, but as he always called yellow
pink and pink yellow no one had been able to
solve the riddle of this hated colour.</p>
<p class="pnext">Long before the boat came alongside Val
recognised Harriott by the condition of her hat.
Mrs. Kesteven's hats invariably looked as though some
one had been taking a siesta on them, but the
moment she got close enough for her little soft,
stern face to be seen no one thought of her hat
any more.  It was the same with her clothes.
She always had an extraordinary stock of last
year's gowns to "finish up," but under the thrall
of her charming manners no one ever noticed that
her skirt was wider than was fashionable and her
sleeves the wrong shape.  It would have been
difficult to compute how many new spring gowns
she had contributed that year to youthful poor
relations, but she herself was "finishing up" a
faded purple linen of weird cut, while the hat
of battered violets on her head was certainly not
in its first season.  But all the glow of friendship
and true affection was in her sunny eyes.  She flew
from the deck of the wheezy old steamer, and in
spite of the Customs' officers' efforts to head her off,
embraced Val over the ropes.  Behind her came
Kitty, very fair, pretty, and beautifully dressed.
Haidee shot a scowl at her.</p>
<p class="pnext">"A Smarty-Arty!" was her inward comment,
though she was slightly overawed by Kitty's clothes.</p>
<p class="pnext">"She 's taller than me, but her feet are bigger,"
thought Kitty.</p>
<p class="pnext">"And this is my Brannikin, Harry."</p>
<p class="pnext">"What a duck! ... give me a kiss, Bran."</p>
<p class="pnext">But Bran retreated behind his mother's skirts
murmuring:</p>
<p class="pnext">"The cat says bow-wow-wow."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Don't be silly, my Wing.  Come on--and say
how do you do.  This is Kitty."</p>
<p class="pnext">"<em class="italics">Je sais bien</em>," said Bran, and handed Kitty
a hardy smile.  Bran knew all things well--at
least that was his favourite response to all remarks.
When Val first took him to Notre Dame and they
knelt together in the light of the wonderful
rose-window, she whispered in his ear:</p>
<p class="pnext">"Brannie, you are in the most beautiful church
in the world."</p>
<p class="pnext">"<em class="italics">Je sais bien</em>," he had answered blandly.</p>
<p class="pnext">They all proceeded to Villa Duval, followed by
the speculative glances of the crowd and the
grocer's handcart carrying Harriott's luggage.
Kitty and Haidee, subtly aware of the
admiring eyes of the two young Frenchmen, assumed
a demure air mingled with light and not too
annihilating scorn.</p>
<p class="pnext">Harriott expressed herself charmed with Villa
Duval and all that therein was, from the rose-tree
on the balustrade that bore both pink and white
roses as a tribute to <em class="italics">pére</em> Duval's skill in grafting,
to the meat-safe suspended by a chain from the
dining-room floor to the cellar below.  After
inspecting the cabins, peeping out of the windows,
and hearkening to the man-eater in the kitchen,
she said:</p>
<p class="pnext">"You don't know how lucky you are, Val, living
in peace and simplicity like this.  You ought to be
a very happy woman."</p>
<p class="pnext">"So I am--happy as a tomtit on a
pump-handle," said Val, smiling gaily, but Harriott,
who had the seeing eye, saw the heart-hunger
behind the smile, and knew that happiness had
eluded her friend once more.</p>
<p class="pnext">"I 've no right to grumble, Harry.  I 've got
what I wanted--a son.  You know I always felt
my life would not be complete without a son--and
he is the son of a real man.  But, if one had
forty sons, there would still always be that little
round hole in one's heart which no child can ever
quite fill--you know, Harriott."</p>
<p class="pnext">Yes, Harriott knew.  Not for nothing had her
beautiful hair turned snow-white at thirty.  She,
too, had a void in her big, warm heart which neither
Kitty nor the dozen impecunious youthful relations
to whom she played godmother had been able to fill.</p>
<p class="pnext">Haidee and Kitty soon became thick as thieves,
and, like thieves, distrusted each other thoroughly.
Blondes and brunettes nearly always do.  Pretending
to be quite unimpressed by each other's looks
secretly each admired the other's type exceedingly,
and in little ways, which they supposed no one
noticed, tried to copy each other's good points in
dress and style.  It was funny to see Haidee,
whose hair had always been a shameful sort of
mane flying to the winds, now brush it out sleek
and straight under a red ribbon (in opposition to
Kitty's blue one) bound <em class="italics">à la Grec</em> above her brow,
while Kitty could not rest until she had discarded
her stockings and bought herself a pair of canvas
sandals at Lemonier's.  She was, to her annoyance,
however, no more able to imitate the tan which
covered Haidee, than the latter could acquire the
milky whiteness of Kitty's complexion.  They set
each other off well--Haidee with her tall dark
beauty, Kitty fair and fluffy as a Persian kitten.
It was small wonder that wherever they went
attention was focused upon them.  The two
French boys were always hovering in the vicinity,
whether on the beach when the party went to
bathe, on the <em class="italics">digue</em> to watch the Jersey boat
arrive--now one of the daily interests--or out
walking on the cliff.  Often, as they sauntered in
the lanes, the girls ahead, Harry and Val loitering
and gossiping behind, the sound of bicycles would
be heard and the two boys would whirr past,
sending swift, hardy glances at the girls, making
the occasion an excuse for apologetically lifting
their caps.</p>
<p class="pnext">"I 'm afraid it's neither you behind your blue
veil, nor I with 'nearly fifty' scrawled across my
features, who is causing such commotion in those
two male bosoms," chuckled Harriott to Val.</p>
<p class="pnext">"It gives one a little shock to feel so out of it!"
said Val, laughing a little.  "When men's eyes
slip past to the girl behind, one begins to realise
that one cannot stay in the great game for ever."</p>
<p class="pnext">"For ever--no," said Harry; "but <em class="italics">you 're</em> not
out of it yet, my dear--you 've only taken the
blue veil for a while."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Oh, Harry, I was out of it the moment Bran
came.  I got my prize, little as I deserved it, and
retired from the arena.  Even if I had n't loved
my man I could never have continued to amuse
myself that way once I had a son."</p>
<p class="pnext">"That doesn't make the least difference to
your attracting power, my dear.  You are one of
those women who will always have for men the
same kind of pull as the moon for the sea."</p>
<p class="pnext">Val laughed a little mournfully as she reflected
that her moonlight quality had not the power to
pull just the one man she wanted across the sea
to her.</p>
<div class="center transition">
<p class="pfirst">――――</p>
</div>
<p class="pfirst">On the third day after the Kestevens' arrival
the Frenchmen achieved acquaintance with Bran
on the beach.  He came back to his party
announcing that "Sacha" and "Rupert" had asked
him if he would like to go out sailing with them.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Come for a walk in their boat they said," he
said, grinning gaily at their literal English.  "And
they asked if my sisters like going out for walks in
a boat, too?"</p>
<p class="pnext">Kitty and Haidee exchanged rapid eye-signals,
then looked away at the sea.  Harriott frowned.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Why don't the idiotic creatures come and call
on us like honest men, or send their women folk?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"He's got no women folk but his sister, and she
hasn't come from Paris yet," burst from Haidee
suddenly.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Whose sister?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Sacha's."</p>
<p class="pnext">"She 's expected on Thursday," supplemented
Kitty.  A minute later the two discovered urgent
business elsewhere--perhaps for fear of being
questioned as to the source of their information.</p>
<p class="pnext">Val and Harriott gazed at each other stupefied.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Goodness! they know all about these French
fellows.  What are we to do?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Take no notice, Harry.  Let them have their
little excitement, dear things.  A woman's life
is so short.  Bran said to me as we lay in bed this
morning, 'Mammie, in 120 months, I 'll be fifteen;
how old will you be?'  And, my dear, I calculated
and found it would bring me up to forty-two--and
another 120 months to fifty-two, and then another,
and life will be done!  Have you ever thought of
it, dear: that our lives are just a series of months
in batches of 120?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"You need not talk yet," sighed Harriott.  "It's
the last few batches that are so short.  The years
fly like greased lightning after forty."</p>
<p class="pnext">"And the early ones seem so long and weary--until
the first love adventure looms in sight.  Ah! those
first little adventures, how lovely they are!
To realise that we are desirable ... that some
one wants us ... finds us pretty and charming
... to feel the little wings of womanhood
sprouting on our shoulder-blades!  Oh, Harry, we
mustn't grudge the enchantment of it to our girls!
Don't you remember how delightful it was?  Was
anything that came after half so wonderful?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"I know," said Harriott, the gentle light of
reminiscence in her eye.  "But this is a different
matter, my dear.  These are <em class="italics">Frenchmen</em>."</p>
<p class="pnext">"But they are really very Irish-looking,"
laughed Val, who not being English never could
understand the curious aversion that sits deep
in almost every Englishwoman's heart for the
male species across the Channel.  "And those two
kids are as happy and excited as larks in the wind.
I 'm sure that kind of thing should never be
suppressed, Harry."</p>
<p class="pnext">"I dare say you are right, dear.  Only we must
make fun of them sometimes so that there shall
be no danger of their taking it seriously.  I think
I 'd rather have Kitty take the veil than take a
Frenchman."</p>
<p class="pnext">That same evening as they all sat playing Bridge
in the little wooden dining-room of Villa Duval, a
whirr of bicycle wheels was heard without.  Then
a silence and the sound of some one walking softly
over the glass and broken china with which the
other side of the road was freely decorated.  Under
the table Haidee handed Kitty a hack on the shins,
but their faces remained bland, their interest in
the game unabated.  It was a black night and to
look out of the window availed nothing.  A few
moments later came the sound of bicycles in
retreat.  At bedtime the two girls stayed whispering
and speculating long in Kitty's room, which
overlooked the road, but the mystery of the bicycles
was unexplained--until the next morning.  Bran,
standing on Val's bed, as was his pleasant custom
when dressing, suddenly shouted--and a shout
in Villa Duval could be heard through every room
in the house.</p>
<p class="pnext">"<em class="italics">What's that red thing in my 'Jules Duval'?</em>"</p>
<p class="pnext">The <em class="italics">Jules Duval</em>, as has been explained, was
<em class="italics">pére</em> Duval's old fishing boat, which had been
fixed-up and painted to be the special joy and plaything
of Bran.  He adored boats and everything to do
with the sea, and spent all his days in the <em class="italics">Jules</em>
going imaginary voyages.</p>
<p class="pnext">"There 's something red fastened to the mast,"
he shrieked excitedly, and upstairs two necks were
craned to cracking point from Kitty's bedroom
window.  Insufficiently clothed as he was Bran
tore out to the boat, and came back bearing in
triumph an enormous cabbage rose--full blown,
and rather tired from being up all night.  Both
girls put out their hands for it.  Bran looked at
them in surprise.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Why, it was in <em class="italics">my</em> boat!  Perhaps an angel put
it there for me..."  The girls turned away
in wrath.  Later they were each seen to go
separately to the <em class="italics">Jules</em> and give a sort of casual
glance into the bottom of it.  It was possible,
of course, that Bran might have overlooked
something!</p>
<p class="pnext">"Only one rose!  How clever of those young
scamps!" chuckled Val, and Harriott with joyful
malice pinned the flopping rose to the breast of
Bran's red sweater, where it drooped its life away.</p>
<p class="pnext">The girls were constrained with each other all
day.  The tide was low and there was no excuse
to go to the beach.  Perhaps that was why the
two took books and sat in the <em class="italics">Jules</em> all the morning
pretending to read, but with a keen lookout on
the road and all stray cyclists.  Bran, greatly
delighted to have passengers, took them several
voyages to New York and back.  Harry and Val,
professing to be busy inside the Villa, cast many
an intrigued glance from the windows.  Nothing
happened.</p>
<p class="pnext">Next morning a basket of figs was found in the
boat--beautiful, luscious, purple figs.  Now the
only fig-trees in Mascaret grew in the garden of
the Admiral of Shai-poo!</p>
<p class="pnext">Val and Harriott went to early Mass, and
returning ran into the two heroes coming up from the
river.  They had been for an early morning sail,
and wore a pleasantly disreputable air in their
blue fisherman jerseys and turned-up coat collars.
They cast sheepish glances at the two ladies, and
the younger had the grace to blush.</p>
<p class="pnext">"They really are nice-looking boys," Harriott
admitted, but at the breakfast table a few minutes
later she expressed herself differently.</p>
<p class="pnext">"We met those two Romeos from the Villa
Shai-poo as we were coming from Mass," she
announced.  "Seedy-looking fellows.  One of
them looked as if a tub might do him good."</p>
<p class="pnext">The girls bristled like Irish terriers.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Which one?" they demanded in one breath.</p>
<p class="pnext">"The one with the drunken blue eyes," said
Val, aware that this was sheer malice.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Oh, that's Rupert!"  Relief burst from Haidee.
But Kitty's appetite was gone.  She assumed a
dark and menacing expression of countenance
that her mother declared reminded her of
Mendelssohn's <em class="italics">Spring Song</em>.</p>
<p class="pnext">"It makes me want to prance and leap like Cissie
Loftus imitating Maude Allen when I see you
look like that, Kit," she said.  But Kit remained
cross as a cat and would not smile.</p>
<p class="pnext">"And where did these figs come from?" asked
Val in amaze.</p>
<p class="pnext">"They are Bran's," quoth Haidee demurely.
"An angel left them in the <em class="italics">Jules</em> for him."</p>
<p class="pnext">It may have been religious fervour which then
seized the girls or it may merely have been a
fervour for going in the direction of Mascaret, at
any rate they patronised both High Mass and
Vespers and seemed to be discontented that there
were no further services to attend.</p>
<p class="pnext">In the evening, as it was Sunday, there were
letters to write instead of the usual game of Bridge.
Every one appeared to be deeply occupied, but a
listening look was so apparent on two faces that
Harriott could not resist a mischievous remark to
Val.</p>
<p class="pnext">"I wonder if the cabbages have come yet?"  As
if by some magical arrangement with fate there
came on the instant the usual whirring sound
followed by the crackling underfoot of broken
crockery which had strayed from the garbage hole.</p>
<p class="pnext">"What's that?" cried Bran nervously from his
bed in the next room.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Hush, my Wing!  I expect it's only a basket
of eggs arriving in the <em class="italics">Jules</em>," soothed his mother.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Soon we shall not have to go to market, Val,"
remarked Harriott; "all that we need will be
found in the boat.  I wonder if it's a Customs'
officer or a gendarme who is so kind?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"I think a delicate attention on our part would
be to tie a return bouquet on to the mainmast,"
said Val thoughtfully.  "Should we go out and
gather some, Harry--just to show that we enjoyed
the figs?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Oh, no!  Val," burst out Haidee, "you 'll spoil
everything."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Spoil?" said Val with wondering eyes.  "<em class="italics">Everything</em>?
Surely a little gratitude...?  Old <em class="italics">père</em>
Duval has some nice sunflowers."</p>
<p class="pnext">But the girls had burst from the room in a rage.
Val and Harriott, exploding with laughter, went
for a walk down the <em class="italics">digue</em> in the mild darkness.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Poor kids!" said Harriott.  "Perhaps we
really ought not to torment them so much."</p>
<p class="pnext">"My dear, it is the proudest moment of their
lives," laughed Val.  "Their first conquest!  At
such times mothers are always looked upon as
sort of ogresses anyway--we may as well be
amused ogresses."</p>
<p class="pnext">They had an adventure all to themselves that
night.  A little party of people passed them
talking French, and bound like themselves for a stroll
to the end of the breakwater.  There were two
ladies and two men, and in the latter Val felt
certain she recognised the boys from Shai-poo.
Behind them, at a little distance, smoking a
deliciously fragrant cigar and humming cheerfully
after the manner of a Frenchman who has just
enjoyed a good dinner, strolled a third man,
evidently belonging to the party, for he called
out an occasional remark to the others.  All
disappeared into the blackness at the far end of the
pier, where a lamp and storm-bell were built into
a little chapel-shaped shelter.  Val and Harriott,
deciding not to walk farther, seated themselves by
dint of a certain amount of physical exertion upon
the high wall which runs beside the <em class="italics">digue</em>, their
legs dangling, the sea below, the cool black night
all round them.  By and by the French party
returned in the order of their going, the last man
still lagging behind.  He had perhaps lingered
longer than the others to watch the seas
dashing against the bulky end of the pier, for the
advance party passed some five minutes before his
cheerful humming was heard.  As he came along
a pale streak of gold from the far lighthouse swept
over him, revealing him an elderly, distinguished
man of the <em class="italics">Légion d'honneur</em> type.  Val
immediately recognised in him the man whom Haidee
had pointed out as General Lorrain, the father of
Sacha: he of the American boots and pointed
goatee.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Ah!  Le phare est très chic ce soir!"  He called
out suddenly.  He had seen them in the same
sweeping line of light, but it never occurred to
them that he mistook them for the ladies of his
party until he came up and gave Harriott an
affectionate squeeze on her ankle, repeating his
remark:</p>
<p class="pnext">"<em class="italics">N'est ce pas</em>, Comtesse--it gives a very <em class="italics">chic</em>
illumination to-night, the lighthouse?"</p>
<p class="pnext">Mrs. Kesteven gave a very <em class="italics">chic</em> gasp, and almost
leaped from the wall into the sea below.  And Val,
realising what had happened, hastily leaned
forward and in her bad French, always ten times worse
when she was excited, cried:</p>
<p class="pnext">"<em class="italics">Mais--vous faisez une erreur, monsieur.</em>"</p>
<p class="pnext">The poor man, horrified as Mrs. Kesteven
herself, blurted out a throaty:</p>
<p class="pnext">"<em class="italics">Parr-don!  Je vous demands parr-don,
mesdames,</em>" and fled.</p>
<p class="pnext">Val said her French did it--that wonderful
phrase "<em class="italics">faisez une erreur</em>," quite unknown to the
French grammar.  But Harriott declared her
suspicion that the quality of her woollen stockings
was the cause of the poor man's panic.</p>
<p class="pnext">"I imagine the French Comtesse whom that
pinch was meant for is not much addicted to Jaeger
and flannel lingerie," she said with a grim glint
of humour in her eye.  "Anyway it is a lesson to
us not to sit out alone on dark nights."</p>
<p class="pnext">Next morning there was a basket of grapes in
the boat.</p>
<p class="pnext">"This is really beginning to go a little too far,"
declared Val.  "Either some one is robbing the
Admiral's garden and wants to drag us into the
affair as accomplices, or else there is an impression
abroad that we are in need of food and clothing."</p>
<p class="pnext">She and Harriott gravely discussed the point as
to whether it would be better to put up a public
notice by the wayside, or call in the gendarmes.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Oh, mother!" cried Kitty in a voice of mingled
consternation and impatience, and wriggled
Mrs. Kesteven into her bedroom where she could
harangue her without ribald interruption from Val.
The minute Haidee got Val alone she said furiously:</p>
<p class="pnext">"Oh, Val, you are a silly ass!  You know quite
well it 's <em class="italics">them</em>!"</p>
<p class="pnext">"<em class="italics">Them?</em>"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Those Lorrain boys.  Do leave off rotting."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Rotting?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Och! <em class="italics">you!</em>" cried Haidee in a black rage, and
flung out of the room.</p>

<div class="vspace" style="height: 2em">
</div>
<p class="pfirst">All the same, Val and Harry were beginning to
say to each other, "What next?"</p>
<p class="pnext">It was a great relief that the Lorrain boys, most
correctly dressed and apparently laced in their
best corsets, came very ceremoniously to call that
afternoon.  They were accompanied by two ladies.
One was Mademoiselle Celine Lorrain, the other
the Comtesse de Vervanne, who had come to
spend part of the summer with them.  Upon
being introduced to the latter, Val and
Mrs. Kesteven, who knew what they knew about a
<em class="italics">chic</em> lighthouse and a lady's ankle, exchanged a
fleet glance that was not without humour.</p>
<p class="pnext">Celine Lorrain, the sister of Sacha, was a girl
of twenty-five, with eyes of Mediterranean blue
in a rather broad sweet face.  The boys had
monopolised all the beauty of the family, but she
had a singularly pure expression, and with her
gallant bearing would have made an ideal Joan of
Arc.  The countess, of a very different type, was,
it transpired, the bosom friend of another and
married Lorrain sister.  She was little and piquant
and plump, and made-up as for the stage.  Pearl
powder lay thick as white velvet on her nose, and
her dark-green eyes were artistically outlined with
spode-blue shadows.  A little mole on her chin
had been carefully blackened--and in her cheeks
was a wild-rose flush out of a box.  A few gilt
streaks in the little dark plaits she wore coiled
over her ears <em class="italics">jeune fille</em> fashion told that at some
past period her hair had been magically changed
to gold, but was now returning to its original colour.
No doubt she was extremely picturesque, and her
manners were charming.  But Val, who always
looked at eyes, noticed that hers, in spite of their
enshrouding blue shadows, were as cold as some
still mountain lake, though, at the same time, full
of the swift brightness of the Parisienne who
misses nothing there is to see.  She included the
two women, the girls, and the room in one rapid
enveloping glance, much as a painter might take
a snapshot of something he meant to examine
more carefully later on, and thereafter took upon
herself the "expense of the conversation," as the
French phrase runs.  Unfortunately, her English
was not so excellent as she believed it to
be--though a good deal more amusing.  In answer
to Val's polite "How do you do?" she responded
affably:</p>
<p class="pnext">"Vary much."  And later she related, with a
pretty little high laugh: "It is the costume in
France for strange womens to visit first, but we
have taken the beef by the horns and come to
see you in case you have not the spirit of the
adventuress."</p>
<p class="pnext">Mrs. Kesteven, fearing that Kitty and Haidee
might disgrace themselves if they listened to much
of this style of thing, gradually wriggled the
conversation back into French, at which they were
all fairly fluent, except Val who, however,
understood everything.  With a general intention to be
amiable, time hung on no one's hands.  Every
one took tea, and the young men made themselves
useful, twisting with ease in the tiny room to hand
cups and bread and butter.</p>
<p class="pnext">"We must all be friends and go walks and swims
together," said the Comtesse.  "I hear your girls
swim beautifully, Madame Valdana.  I want
them to teach me."</p>
<p class="pnext">"And would you let them go sailing with us in our
little sailing boat?" a voice beguiled in Val's ear,
and she found the misty blue eyes which she had
maliciously described as "drunken" looking at her.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Oh, I don't know about that," she said in her
faltering French.</p>
<p class="pnext">"You spik in English and I spik in French and
we will understand us," he said, smiling charmingly
at her.  He reminded her intensely of Bran, and
for this reason she felt a great leaning to him.
Besides, no one could have helped liking him.
His fresh clear skin was made fresher by the
blueness of his eyes and the blackness of his hair.
Added to his boyish beauty was a sort of good
honest look that warmed the heart.</p>
<p class="pnext">"We are very all right sailors," he continued,
still politely expressing himself in English.  "My
cousin and I have sailed our boat here every year
since we had ten years of age.  You need not have
fear of accidents."</p>
<p class="pnext">"My sister often goes with us," chimed in
Sacha, "but she's getting lazy.  Mademoiselle
your daughter and Mees Kesteven both say they
adore to go on the sea."</p>
<p class="pnext">Val let them remain under the impression that
Haidee was her daughter, feeling that it gave her
more authority to shake her head at the idea of
the girls going sailing.  But the chorus of
beguilements continued and the two girls kept
saying:</p>
<p class="pnext">"Oh, do, Val ... <em class="italics">do</em>, mother ... <em class="italics">do</em> ... <em class="italics">do</em>...."</p>
<p class="pnext">Bran made a diversion by bursting in, bright
of eye, his fair hair wild, a strong scent of puppy
dog about him, for he had been amusing himself
with a litter of terriers bred by <em class="italics">pére</em> Duval.</p>
<p class="pnext">He was introduced to the company, but his
news would hardly keep until the ceremony was over.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Mammie!  At last I 've found out the difference
between boy puppies and girl puppies.
The boys----"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Go and wash your hands for tea, darling."</p>
<p class="pnext">"But, Mammie, the boys--</p>
<p class="pnext">"Yes, I know, Bran, go now and wash your----"</p>
<p class="pnext">"The boys have blue eyes and the girls have
brown ones," he shouted indignantly as, hurt and
astonished at his mother's strange lack of interest
in his latest discovery, he was being pushed from
the room by Haidee.  Val suddenly ran after him
and hugged him, and every one exploded into
laughter.</p>
<p class="pnext">Val and Harriott found themselves almost
mesmerised into giving half-promises to let the
girls go sailing, but after the visitors were gone
and the last echo of the Comtesse's little gay
sky-high laugh had died away, they gazed at
each other doubtfully.  The mesmerism was
wearing off.</p>
<p class="pnext">"I don't think we ought to let them go,"
Mrs. Kesteven said.</p>
<p class="pnext">"I 'm sure we ought not," declared Val,
wondering what Westenra would say if Haidee were
drowned.  There was a chorus of howls.  Kitty
put on her <em class="italics">Spring Song</em> face.  Haidee's expression
resembled that of a rhino about to charge.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Mother, you <em class="italics">promised</em>...!"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Oh, Val, you mean pig...!"</p>
<p class="pnext">They burst from the room, scowling and muttering.
Later even sobs were heard upstairs.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Perhaps, after all...?" Harriott wavered.</p>
<p class="pnext">"They are, I 'm sure, nice boys..." said Val,
"and evidently good sailors.  Shall we ask <em class="italics">père</em>
Duval?"</p>
<p class="pnext">They found the latter, as usual, hoeing his
garden, Bran assisting him.  Bran loved <em class="italics">père</em>
Duval, who, he said, "smelt like a bar of iron
that had been lying at the bottom of the sea for a
few weeks ... all green and rusty, but yet nice."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Of those two boys," the old man peered at
them with his bleary eyes, "you need have no fear,
mesdames.  There are no better sailors on this
coast.  And round here it is very safe too--no
bad winds--safe as heaven."</p>
<p class="pnext">Less uneasy, they went upstairs to throw the
oil of consent upon the stormy waters of rebellion.
Immediately the two began to get out their
sweaters and warm skirts as if to start at once,
though the sail had been fixed for next morning.
Harriott and Val stood smiling grimly, throwing
little darts.</p>
<p class="pnext">"I hope you 'll take your tubs before you go--even
though you may get an unpremeditated dip,"
gibed Harriott.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Yes; brush your teeth, dears, and your hair,"
supplemented the other tormentor.  "Don't go
out looking like a pair of rabbits plucked out of a
dust barrel."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Rabbits!  Dust barrels!" snorted the girls,
shaking their hair, each strong in the consciousness
of annihilating beauty.  Afterwards Haidee said
with a superior smile to Kitty:</p>
<p class="pnext">"Poor things!  It must be awful to be old."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Yes," said Kitty, who was sniffing a good deal.
"They 're mad with jealousy.  That's why I don't
take any notice of all Mother's blither."  She
added thoughtfully: "I hope she doesn't find out
I 've got a cold, before to-morrow morning.
She 's such a fuss pot."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Let's go to bed early, then she won't,"
suggested Haidee.  And they went, and rose early
too.  Usually it was the work of two persons to
pick them out of their blankets, but they were up
at five, pinking and preening before the mirror,
with many a glance from the window to see why
the river was n't filling.  The tide, it seemed, was
unaccountably delayed that morning!</p>
<p class="pnext">Val, who always rose at seven to make tea on
her spirit lamp, took the usual cup to Harriott's
bedside, and found Kitty there by special
command.  She was vehemently denying that she
had a cold.</p>
<p class="pnext">"I hawed god wud, buther, I ted you."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Kitty, how can you say so?  You can't speak
properly.  All traffic in your nose is absolutely
suspended."</p>
<p class="pnext">"It tiddent, buther!"</p>
<p class="pnext">"You are snorting and snuffling like the bull of
Bashan."</p>
<p class="pnext">"I 'b <em class="italics">dot</em>, buther."</p>
<p class="pnext">"I 'm sure it's no good for her to go out in that
state," sighed Harriott afterwards.  "But what
would you?  She 'd have broken a blood vessel
if I 'd stopped her."</p>
<p class="pnext">Val looked out of the window and reported
gleefully:</p>
<p class="pnext">"They are prowling up and down the <em class="italics">digue</em> like
two hungry tigers.  If they could only pull the
tide in with ropes they would set to work at once."</p>
<p class="pnext">At last there was water enough to float a boat,
and the Lorrains' little craft was seen winging down
the river from the <em class="italics">petit port</em>.  The girls came racing
back to get their warm coats.  A moment later
Bran's voice was heard from the front steps:</p>
<p class="pnext">"I want to go too--I want to go too!"  He had
smelt what was in the wind, and hastily shuffling
on his little garments was following the girls.
With the cold brutality of an elder sister Haidee
rebuffed him.</p>
<p class="pnext">"No; you can't come.  We don't want any kids."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Besides, you can't swim," said Kitty more kindly.</p>
<p class="pnext">"I can swim--I can swim!" averred Bran, and
ran after them wailing passionately.  "I can
swim--I <em class="italics">can</em> swim!"</p>
<p class="pnext">Val had to fly out and bring him home weeping
on her shoulder.</p>
<p class="pnext">"You shall have a beautiful boat all your own
some day, my Wing, and we 'll sail away in it
together."</p>
<p class="pnext">She comforted him, drying his tears on her blue
veil.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Oh, jeer buck!" sniffled Bran, trying to cheer
up, "and will daddy come too?"</p>
<p class="pnext">Val thought of a lost ship in which she had
thought to sail with all she loved to the islands of
the blest, and her breath caught in her throat.
"Yes, darling, let us pray so," she said, though
she had no hope.</p>
<div class="center transition">
<p class="pfirst">――――</p>
</div>
<p class="pfirst">From that day forward the Shai-pooites and the
Duvalites were constantly together.  The two
parties joined forces and were as one man in all
things that pertained to amusements and making
the sunny days fly by.</p>
<p class="pnext">There was always the daily excursion to the
beach.  Kitty and Haidee were as much at home
in the water as two seals, and Val too was a good
swimmer.  Harriott always turned blue when she
had been in two or three minutes, so her lot in
life was to stay on the beach and rub Bran down
when he came from floundering like a little
scarlet tadpole in the surf.  The Insanes wore red
twill costumes, and resembled nothing so much as
a band of Indians on the warpath when they
came prancing from the cabins across the flat
beach, with the Shai-pooites in dark blue <em class="italics">maillots</em>
at their heels.  A strange note of colour was a
scarf of deep orange, which Val wore round her
head, dock fashion.  She never let her cropped
head be seen by any one, though it was well
covered now with little sprouting fluffy curls.
Only Bran was allowed to see it in the nights, and
loved to nestle against it, as a bird nestles against
the downy breast of its mother.  From the rest
of the world she kept her distance, even in the
sea, for she hated any one to see the curiousness of
her face without its frame of hair.</p>
<p class="pnext">The Comtesse was learning to "make the
plank"--otherwise float, and on calm days
incessant laughter came streaming over the smooth,
silky waves, as her plump little person was held
up by a ring of instructors.  When all seemed
well they let go, and immediately a shrill cry
would ring out:</p>
<p class="pnext">"<em class="italics">Ah, mon Dieu!  Je coule....  Je coule dans
le milieu</em>.  I am sinking in ze middle!"  And down
she would drop and come up spluttering: "Ah!
<em class="italics">Quelle abomination de la désolation!</em>"</p>
<p class="pnext">But she never went in deep enough to damage
the wild-rose flush in her cheeks and the blue
mountain shadows round her eyes.  The two
English girls and Celine Lorrain came out always
sleek as seals, their hair dripping and dank about
them, but when Madame de Vervanne's cerise
head-wrap was unbound, never a hair was out of
place.  She thoroughly understood the art of
bathing beautifully.  Later, arrayed in a wondrous
kimono, she would take a sun bath on the beach,
scuffling her bare feet daintily in the sand.</p>
<p class="pnext">"<em class="italics">Imaginez-vous!</em>" she told Mrs. Kesteven.  "I
never knew until this year that I had Greek feet.
<em class="italics">Le vrai grec</em>, with the arch and perfect toes--see?"  She
stuck out her short white foot.  "An artist
revealed it to me this year.  Figure it to yourself!
I have had them all these years and did not know."</p>
<p class="pnext">She flung her little laugh to heaven, and the
other women could not but join in it at this frank
exhibition of vanity.  Never was a little lady more
thoroughly pleased with herself than Christiane de
Vervanne, and, indeed, she was of those who add
to the gaiety of nations.  Without her cold,
brilliant wit and Harriott Kesteven's gentle
humour the party might easily have been heavy.
Val, shrouding a brooding heart as well as a
cropped head behind her blue veil, came forth
little except when alone with Harriott or the
children, whilst Kitty and Haidee, alternately
weighed down by the new-born consciousness of
their wonderful beauty and absolute desirability,
were not amusing except unintentionally, and
often indeed when their plans went wrong were
sulky and quarrelsome.  At other times they
would be buoyed up to a pitch of perky inanity
most provoking.  But on the whole the two girls
improved noticeably under the influence of their
first flirtation.  Haidee's cowboy habits dropped
from her one by one never to return, and untidiness
was no longer a habit.  Kitty became gentler,
too, and less inclined to treat her mother as a slave
sent unto the world for her special benefit.
Respect for their elders is one of the most attractive
traits in the character of young French people, and
the girls were quick to note the astonishment and
disapproval of the Lorrains at any discourtesy
shown by them to Val and Harriott.  An actual
demonstration of how parents should be treated
could not be given by Sacha and Celine unfortunately,
for (for reasons of his own at which
Mrs. Kesteven and Val could make a good guess),
General Lorrain, their only surviving parent,
never called with his family at Villa Duval, nor
even materialised when the English party took
tea at Shai-poo.  Val and Harriott often wondered
whether he had taken the Comtesse into his
confidence over the little <em class="italics">contretemps</em> on the <em class="italics">digue</em>
when Mrs. Kesteven's ankle had been mistaken
for that of Madame de Vervanne's.  Certainly
the latter gave no sign.</p>
<p class="pnext">It transpired that she was in the position so
unfortunate in France of having been obliged to
divorce her husband.  She was most frank about
the details of her conjugal unhappiness, and the
fact that she had been thrust a little way out of
her own world since the divorce, did not seem to
weigh her down very much.  The Lorrains were
among the few of her liberal and broad-minded
friends to whom her position had made no difference.
Her husband had been an officer in General
Lorrain's regiment, and she married him when she
was eighteen and he thirty and <em class="italics">très connaisseur</em>.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Like most young girls I thought it was a very
wonderful thing for him that I was conferring my
innocence upon him--that he too shared my state
of ecstatic bliss, and that it would last for ever.
<em class="italics">Quelle bêtise</em>!  Naturally for him it was nothing--he
was soon <em class="italics">ennuyée</em> with my bliss.  That is a
mistake young girls make--they soon bore a
sophisticated man with their simplicity."</p>
<p class="pnext">"A sophisticated Frenchman, I dare say," said
Harriott dryly.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Ah!  There you hit the affair on the back,
Mistress Kesteven," agreed the Comtesse affably.
"I do not spik of your Englishmen with the big
hearts and the big feets."</p>
<p class="pnext">She proceeded to describe the lady who stole her
husband.</p>
<p class="pnext">"She was my best friend, and I was very proud
to know her--very <em class="italics">chic</em>, very Parisienne, and with
the cleverness of forty.  Ah! she was as subtle as
an Egyptian!  What chance had I against her
when she began to put her cobra spells on de
Vervanne?  I could only look on like a fascinated
rabbit."  She burst into a peal of laughter.  Val
looked at her thoughtfully, wondering if she were
the result of her ill luck or the cause of it.
Certainly she had arrived at being much more like
the cobra than the rabbit.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Did you ever hear of the little baker's girl, who
had to carry round the tarts and cakes to her
master's customers?  Some one said to her, 'Do
you never take any of the nice tarts, my child?'  'Oh,
no,' said she, 'that would be stealing.  I only
lick them, and that does no one any harm.'"</p>
<p class="pnext">Harriott threw an apprehensive glance ahead.
They were taking one of their long country walks,
the younger folk marching in front, with Bran
and a tea-basket to leaven their exuberance.  It
was a relief to see that they were out of ear-shot,
for the Comtesse's baker-girl stories were apt to be
very spiced bread indeed, and less likely to point
a moral than to adorn some one without morals.</p>
<p class="pnext">"If my friend had only been like the little
<em class="italics">boulangère</em>," continued the Comtesse mournfully,
"I would have said nothing.  But no, she was
greedy and wicked, and could not content herself
except by stealing my nice cake."  She trilled
and bubbled with laughter.  The other woman's
thought, if interpreted, might have read much the
same as Wolfe Tone's brief reflections on the
subject of Madame de Vervanne's countrywomen:</p>
<p class="pnext">"A fine morality, split me!"</p>
<p class="pnext">At the same time it was impossible not to feel a
touch of admiration for a woman who could turn
her tragedy into laughter.  Val was wistfully
inclined to wish that she could achieve the same
state of philosophy herself.</p>
<p class="pnext">Meanwhile the Comtesse, very pleased with
her little tale, and the thought that she had shocked
the "women made of wood," as she secretly
described all Englishwomen, walked ahead, for the
path had narrowed, her skirt held high to avoid the
brambles, revealing the famous Greek feet encased
in high-heeled <em class="italics">suède</em> shoes, with a pair of boy's
socks falling round her ankles.  She affected these
at the seaside, under the impression that she was
being truly Arcadian.  Suddenly she burst into a
little song.  Her voice was dainty and pretty,
her specialty innocent nursery rhymes with a tang
to the tail of them.  She never sang anything that
was not of eighteenth-century origin.  All of her
songs were about shepherdesses and <em class="italics">boulangères</em>--sometimes
a curé would be introduced into the
last verse, but his presence there rarely imported
holiness.</p>
<p class="pnext">When the kettle was singing over the fire of
wood branches, and the band sat scattered at ease
among golden clumps of gorse and purple heather,
she trilled them one of the least frisky in her
vocabulary:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>

<p class="pfirst">One morning Harriott came into Val's room
and found her writing at the table with the
blue veil fallen off, lying on her shoulders.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Why, Val!" she exclaimed in genuine astonishment.
"Your hair is perfectly lovely!  Never,
never cover it up any more!"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Really?" said Val shyly and flushing deep
rose.  "Do you think I might go without the veil
now?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Do I think!  Look at yourself!"  She gave
Val a gentle push towards her mirror, where the
pale oval face was reflected, a very girlish face
still in spite of sorrows, and framed now in a
nebulous, wavering frame of feathery, fluttering curls.</p>
<p class="pnext">"I never saw anything so dear," said Harriott,
dipping her hand into the airy softness.  "It is ten
times prettier than it was before.  How on earth
did you manage it?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"It must be the salad oil," said Val laughing.
"I 've rubbed in a whole quart bottle during
the winter.  Poor Bran!  Many is the morning
he has come sniffing to my pillow with the
question, 'Did you have potato salad for supper last
night, Mammie?'  Is n't it extraordinary what
we women will do for vanity's sake, Harry.
You 'd think I ought to know better at thirty-two,
wouldn't you?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Thirty-two, what's <em class="italics">that</em>?  Women are only
just beginning to find themselves at thirty.
You 're an infant still, my dear, and fortunately
you look it."  She added inconsequently, "I
think that man of yours must be a pig."</p>
<p class="pnext">A grave sadness came back into Val's face.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Never say anything like that, Harry.  Those
are the kind of words that separate friends."</p>
<p class="pnext">For a moment Mrs. Kesteven regarded her
reproachfully, but her soul was too loyal a one to
misunderstand Val's feelings.  There was a great
soul-likeness between the two women.  Only that
Val would be always more or less primitive, while
Harriott Kesteven had come of a long line of
cultivated ancestors, and was more highly civilised.
But in the simple elementary things the two felt
and saw alike.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Forgive me, dearest," she said gently.  "It is
only that I hate to see you so alone--and lonely.
You were not meant for such a life."</p>
<p class="pnext">"I must be unworthy of companionship, for it
is always taken from me," said Val, as if to herself,
staring at her image in the glass.  "I sometimes
tremble because of Bran.  Oh, Harry, if
Bran--if Bran--!"  Her eyes darkened with tears, her
lips twisted in an anguish of terror and love and
foreboding.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Never think of such a thing," cried Harriott.
"It is like inviting the daughter of Zeus to come
after you.  You will have Bran and much more
than Bran, dear.  Your life is far from over.
There are those whom Sorrow elects her own for
many years only to bless them in the end.  All
will come right with you yet, Val."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Bless you, Harry!  What would one do
without friendship?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Well, you'll never have to do without me
wherever you are, darling.  Mine is one of the
hands stretched across seas and hills to you.  But
I fear that my material body must leave you this
day week; all sorts of things call me back to
London."</p>
<p class="pnext">"So soon?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"My dear, do you realise that the summer is
nearly over?  While we have sat in the sunshine
talking of old days, and watching the children
grow their wings, two of our precious months are
gone.  Two of the hundred and twenty, Val!"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Never mind, they 've left us something," said
Val, kissing her.</p>
<p class="pnext">From that day forward she discarded the blue
veil.  The French friends were amazed when they
saw her without her shroudings.  It had a curiously
different effect upon them all.  Something
discontented and critical came into the still-lake
eyes of Madame de Vervanne, but Celine used to
like to come close and brush her cheek against
Val's head as if she or Val were a kitten.  The
two boys seemed suddenly to wake up and realise
that Val was still a factor in the game, at least
Sacha did, and the look half gallant, half
appraising, which he had so far kept only for Kitty and
Haidee or any other pretty girl who happened
along, began to lurk in his eye for Val also.  With
Rupert it was a little different.  He had from the
first recognised something vital and alluring behind
the blue veil, and had never shown himself averse
to leaving the girls to walk with Val, carrying her
things, or holding one of Bran's hands while she
held the other.  There had come to exist between
them one of those wordless sympathies that make
for friendship.  They spoke the same language,
for there was one great bond between them--the
wanderlust.  Rupert, strange and rare thing in a
Frenchman, had "the love for other lands!"  Hoping
to assuage his thirst for travel in a
legitimate way, and one traditional in his family,
he had entered for the Navy and had worked hard
to get in from the Lycée St. Louis.  But though
his physical qualifications for that profession were
perfect, he was no student and the exams. had
been too much for him.  Three times he had gone
up, and failed, and the third time was the last.  He
was over nineteen, and the age limit for men
entering the Navy was passed.</p>
<p class="pnext">At odds and ends of times he told Val these
things, and her heart went out to him while her
mind greatly wondered at the stupidity of the
French Government.  Here was an ideal sailor
lost to his country because he could not pass a
difficult exam., that dealt largely with languages
and mathematics, though you had only to watch
him with his inferiors, the villagers and fishermen,
to know that he possessed all the qualities
characteristic of the good sailor and commander of
men.  Above all he was a lover of the sea.  As an
Englishman or American other gates to that
"lover and mother of men" would have been open
to him.  But as a French gentleman having failed
to get into the Navy, he was obliged to renounce
the love of his life, for there was no other way,
compatible with honour, of wooing her.</p>
<p class="pnext">The next best thing then he declared was to join
the Colonial Infantry, and achieve travel and
adventure in foreign service.  But such a decision
thoroughly scandalised his family, for the Colonial
Infantry is looked upon as the last resort of the
destitute.  Only men who have n't a penny of
private income go to the Colonies, and it was
considered a most unfitting fate for a man of such
brilliant fortune as Rupert would be master of in a
year or so.  Even Sacha, who had no more than
two hundred and twenty francs a year, disdained
the Colonial Infantry and was in the "Dragons,"
preferring a cavalry regiment likely to be
stationed within reach of Paris, living a life of gaiety
on credit, always in debt, but always with an open
chance of catching an heiress whose fortune would
regulate his affairs and settle him in life.</p>
<p class="pnext">The Colonial Infantry very often means quick
promotion, but it also means travel and rough
life in far places, and these things do not appeal
to the ordinary young Frenchman, who is out for
"life" of a very different kind.  That they
appealed to Rupert showed that he was far from
being an ordinary Frenchman.  In his family
everything was still being done to try and dissuade
him.  But he showed no signs of budging from his
purpose--for him the Colonial Infantry or nothing,
he said, and had already accomplished the one
year's military service essential to a candidate for
St. Cyr.  He told Val of his intentions, and she
secretly upheld them and encouraged him to go
his own way.  For to her Rupert looked like one
of those whom Nature chooses to track her
across deserts and mountains and seas.  He had
the vague yet ardent eyes of the follower of the
Lone Trail.  Val recognised in him, boy as he was,
a wanderer like herself, and it seemed to her that
it would be a tragic thing to confine such a boy to
the smug and conventional paths of life in France.</p>
<p class="pnext">While the Kestevens were still in Mascaret,
Rupert was looked upon as being more or less
property at the disposal of Kitty, and Val had only
an occasional opportunity for the long rambling
talks she liked with him.  But after the Kestevens
had gone, and Val made her <em class="italics">début</em>, veilless, indeed
hatless, with shining fluffy hair curling in the sun,
her eyes containing a secret, and about her that
certain flower-like grace which is the peculiar
attribute of those who keep always a little dew
in the heart, Rupert came hovering continually
about her and she grew fonder than ever of him.
A reef was taken in their friendship, and no one
seemed to mind very much except Christiane de
Vervanne.  The little Comtesse took rather more
than an ordinary interest in Rupert, and when she
was about, Val with her seventh sense often felt in
the air the presence of the little silken cobwebs that
some women, spiderlike, spin out and weave about
all young male things.  However, Rupert so far
appeared to be immune to any spells except those
of the sea, and other lands.  And because Val too
felt these spells he loved to be with her.  The
Comtesse, on the other hand, looked upon such talk
as the ravings of madness.  She strongly opposed
the Colonial Infantry scheme, and declared it a
shame to think of one of La France's sons
departing to other stupid countries.  It was plain that
she meant to do all she could to prevent such a
catastrophe.</p>
<p class="pnext">It was lovely autumn weather, and in the cool
of every afternoon the party went forth on
blackberrying expeditions, gathering the fruit which the
peasants despise and leave to rot upon the hedges.
Every morning Villa Duval was fragrant with the
fresh scent of blackberries stewing in their own
juice, to be eaten at tea time the same day.  The
flies and the wasps swarmed in, and at intervals all
doors and windows would be closed and the family,
assisted by the granite-eyed Azalie and armed with
bath towels, would engage in a <em class="italics">grande battue</em>, and
the wooden walls of the villa resounded with slaps
and bangs.  Only Bran would take no part in these
massacres.  He had a funny little objection to
killing anything, and strongly disapproved of
Azalie's methods.</p>
<p class="pnext">"She is very unkind," he complained.  "She
just <em class="italics">kills</em> the flies.  She does n't look into their
eyes first to see whether they are poor or good or
naughty."</p>
<p class="pnext">"How do they look when they 're good, assie?"
jeered Haidee.</p>
<p class="pnext">Bran strangely but immediately glazed his
eyes, and with some odd movement of his hands
acutely suggested the attitude of a sick fly
suffering with cold.</p>
<p class="pnext">"And a naughty one?"</p>
<p class="pnext">His eyes rolled, and he lifted a paw to his nose.
A sprightly fly!</p>
<p class="pnext">The days were slipping along very peacefully
when suddenly Val's eyes were opened to the
fact that Haidee was in danger.  Her little girlish
flirtation with Sacha Lorrain was growing into
something more serious.</p>
<p class="pnext">One afternoon, as Val was sitting in the <em class="italics">Jules</em>,
with Bran at the imaginary wheel, a puff of wind
blew a sheet of paper up into the air and over the
side of the boat.  Carelessly she took it up, but
her idle glance crystallised into consternation
when she found that it was a rough draft of what
was evidently meant to be a poem, in Haidee's
writing.</p>
<p class="pnext">That an out-of-door, tomboy creature like
Haidee should take to writing poems was strange
enough, but what startled Val still more was its
open dedication to Sacha.  It ran into several
verses:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line">"You are more beautiful than the rising sun,</div>
<div class="inner line-block">
<div class="line">And I love you more,</div>
</div>
<div class="line">And I wish to steal you and keep you</div>
<div class="inner line-block">
<div class="line">As in the old, old law.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
</div>
<div class="line">"For you are mine, you were born for me:</div>
<div class="inner line-block">
<div class="line">It is written in the book of Fate</div>
</div>
<div class="line">That thou should 'st love me, and I love thee--</div>
<div class="inner line-block">
<div class="line">Do now, 'fore it is too late.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
</div>
<div class="line">"Come to me now, to my ever open arms,</div>
<div class="inner line-block">
<div class="line">And make me glad,</div>
</div>
<div class="line">And I will mark our meeting with an everlasting kiss</div>
<div class="inner line-block">
<div class="line">To make us sad."</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="pfirst">Poor Haidee!</p>
<p class="pnext">When Val had finished reading it her eyes were
full of tears, though her lips smiled.  It was not
poetry, but in its broken, ill-balanced phrases it
revealed what poetry does not always do--the
heart of the writer and the big things in the writer's
nature struggling to get out.  The old cowboy
rudeness and lawlessness were there, but Val was so
thankful to God to see the sign of big things--of
generosity, of the courage that dares, of soul.
Yes, there under the beat of young passion's wing
was another still small sweet sound--the voice of
soul.  What else did those two last lines reveal?</p>
<blockquote>
<div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="inner line-block">
<div class="line">"...an everlasting kiss</div>
</div>
<div class="line">To make us sad."</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="pfirst">Only the soul knows the secret of that great
sadness lurking under passion's wing!</p>
<p class="pnext">Poor Haidee!  So her feet, too, were touching the
outer waves of that stormy sea where women sink
or swim, and few reach the happy shore!  Yet
Val was proud to recognise that she was not
afraid to put forth.  This was no suppliant cry
of one afraid to drown!  Here was not one of the
world's little clinging creatures that grip round a
man's neck and pull him under.  She, too, had
the strong arm and the stout heart.  She would
give help, not only seek to take it.  Yes, that was
what Haidee's poor little poem revealed more
than anything to Val--that she was one of life's
givers.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Thank God for it," said Val, "and let her
give."  After long thought, doubled up in Bran's
boat and staring at the sea as was her way, she
added: "but not to Sacha Lorrain."</p>
<p class="pnext">It is not to be supposed that she had spent a
whole summer of intimacy with the Lorrain family
without drawing up some kind of a moral estimate
of each member of it.  They were not very harsh
affairs, these little estimates.  For it was ever
Val's way to "heave her log" into the heart rather
than the mind, and to what was in the pocket she
never gave a thought.  Like many of the cleverest
women, she had no judgment, no gift of looking
past the hardy eye and the smooth smile into the
mind to see what was brewing there.  But she had
instincts, and sometimes inspirations, and a highly
tuned ear for sincerity.  Also, no act or look or
word containing beauty was ever lost on her.</p>
<p class="pnext">Well! it must be confessed that Sacha had
emerged but poorly from her process of assessment.
She had turned her ear and inclined her
eye for many a long day for grace in him--and
both had gone unrequited.</p>
<p class="pnext">If Sacha's worldly possessions were small, they
still predominated over his jewels of the heart,
while in mind he possessed much the same
qualities as Christiane de Vervanne--gaiety, egotism,
the hard, cold brilliance of a diamond, a straining
ambition for all the worldly "good things of life."  In
their alikeness these two might have been
brother and sister, while Celine and Rupert,
though only cousins, much more closely resembled
each other in nature and bearing.</p>
<p class="pnext">It seemed the usual irony of circumstance that
had ordained for Sacha, who loved the good things
of the world, comparative poverty, while to Rupert,
the John o' Dreams and lover of seas and skies,
was given wealth!  The latter's father (the
general's brother), with a head for finance, had
gone into banking instead of the army, and
thereafter married a banker's daughter with a fortune,
which he had trebled and quadrupled to leave to
their only son.</p>
<p class="pnext">However, Sacha, with a small income squeezed
out of his father's pension, gave himself a very
good time, and had every intention and likelihood
of making a rich marriage.  In the meantime
he was open to any love experiences that came to
hand.  Like all young Frenchmen, he preferred
women older than himself, and went in fear of the
young girl--when she was French.  But this
summer no flirtations with women older than
himself had offered; Mrs. Kesteven treated him like a
grandson, Val was secret behind her veil, while the
Comtesse's beguilements were not for him--he and
she understood each other too well.  Remained
Haidee, who was <em class="italics">jeune fille</em> indeed, without being
French.</p>
<p class="pnext">Her daring boyish ways and fresh beauty
attracted him immensely, and though he was an
honourable fellow, according to his lights, the
lights of a young French officer make no very great
illumination, and apparently he had not been able
to resist the temptation of making her fall in love
with him.</p>
<p class="pnext">Val, reviewing the position, knew that it would
be fatal to let Haidee lose her head over this
young worldling.  He was only amusing himself.
No Frenchman who is poor ever contemplates
marriage with a girl unless she happens to have a
<em class="italics">dot</em> worthy of consideration, in which case the
affair becomes a ceremonious one in which parents
and relations take an even more important part
than the young people themselves.  Val knew all
this well, and that there was not the faintest idea
of anything serious in Sacha Lorrain's mind.  But,
no doubt, it was very amusing to make a little
American girl fall in love--and to him appeared
harmless enough.  Only, it would have to be put
a stop to at once, though at first Val did not
quite see how.  Impossible to break off friendly
relations all at once with the occupants of
Shai-poo.  They had all become too intimate for that.
Besides, such an act would not serve its purpose.
Haidee was too wilful and lawless not to find means
of being with the Lorrains whatever Val did, and
opposition would simply have the effect of making
her keener.  The only course open to Val was one
that Sacha himself had suggested by his manner
since she came out from behind her blue veil.
Whether it was that he was piqued by her
preference for his cousin, or whether he thought a little
jealousy might be good for Haidee, it would be
hard to say, but at any rate he had shown distinct
signs and symbols of being attracted to Val.  So
far she had disregarded, while being greatly amused
by his not very subtle efforts to flirt with her, but
she now resolved to make a change in her tactics.
If Sacha wanted a flirtation with a woman older
than himself he should have it.</p>
<p class="pnext">She gave him an opening the very next day on
one of their long excursions, and he grabbed it with
a fervour that astonished her.  She kept him at
her side all the afternoon.  Rupert took her
defection good-naturedly, and devoted himself to Haidee,
who rebuffed him and sulked.  The next day, on
the beach, Val did the same thing.  Sacha
became more fervent.  Rupert began to look
wounded.  Haidee glared, and would not speak when
they reached home.</p>
<p class="pnext">After all, it was an easy matter.  What
inexperienced girl, however pretty, can hold her own
against a woman of the world, determined on
capture--especially when the prey is only a
youth?  Sacha, his vanity flattered by Val's
sudden interest in him, paid little attention to
Haidee's scowls and sulks.  And when Val realised
how serious it was, saw how Haidee paled and
flushed and lost her appetite, she lured the
mothlike Sacha all the more within the radius of the
flame which attracted him.  She did not mean to
burn him, only to dazzle him a little; but if his
wings were slightly scorched, that was his affair.
Haidee had got to be saved from unhappiness even
at that cost.</p>
<p class="pnext">The thing was made easier by the departure of
the Comtesse and Celine to pay a week's visit to
some army friends stationed at Cherbourg.  With
no one left but the two boys, it was simple for
Val to take entire possession of Sacha.  Haidee
was left to the share of Rupert.  She liked Rupert
well enough--no one could help it.  But she
was in love with Sacha.  Before long the look of
an assassin came into her eyes when she turned
them upon Val.  But Val did not falter in her
purpose.  Not even when Rupert withdrew from
the quartette and let Sacha come alone to the villa.
On such occasions they all went out together as
usual, but Val kept Sacha by her side.  She was
the soul of gaiety, she flirted and spun fine threads.
Haidee gloomed and grew paler.  Val's heart
ached for the girl, and she was sick of the business
herself, but Sacha's leave was almost up.  It was
only a matter of days.  She determined to stick at
the wicket.</p>
<p class="pnext">On Sacha's last evening the whole party from
Shai-poo came to Villa Duval with the suggestion
of a moonlight walk to the cliff point near the
lighthouse.  The Comtesse and Celine had returned
from Cherbourg bringing in tow a young cavalry
lieutenant, a friend of Sacha's, and plainly a
satellite of Christiane de Vervanne.  The object of
the walk was to re-cement a wooden cross upon
the ruined walls of the old church of Mascaret.
The village in some by-gone age had been situated
on the North Foreland, but the gales and storms
that besieged it there had driven the villagers
inland, and no trace remained of habitation except
the four walls of a primitive church, battered and
time-stained, pitched perilously on the side of the
cliff, like wreckage flung there by some wild storm
from the sea below.  The little wooden cross that
leaned crazily on the east wall had been put there
many years past by Rupert and Sacha, and it
was a sort of religious rite with them to re-cement
it upright in its place every year.</p>
<p class="pnext">It was a glorious night for a walk, and when
they came to claim her, Val could make no
excuse for not going, though all that day a wave
of dreariness had possessed and submerged her,
making her long to be alone.  She could not plead
that Bran would be lonely, for, tired out from an
afternoon's net-fishing in the shallows of the river,
he was deep asleep, and Hortense by some
unwonted chance was available to watch over
him.  Besides, Haidee looked so wretched and
wistful that compassion overcame reason in
Val.  She began to half doubt her right of
interference.  Because of this she allowed herself
to be taken possession of by Rupert and Celine,
while the Comtesse and her lieutenant went on
ahead, so that nothing was left for Sacha to do but
walk with Haidee.  He did it with so bad a grace
that the latter was even more unhappy than if she
had been left to herself.  The two walked in silence
and when they were winding in single file round the
face of the cliff Sacha made a determined effort to
regain Val, but she cold-bloodedly hedged him off.
She saw now very plainly that her labour was at an
end.  He and Haidee were so thoroughly estranged
that all danger was past, and her task over.
Subtly her manner changed then to one of half
quizzing gaiety extremely disconcerting to the
amorous Sacha, and yet with which he could find
no fault, for her flirtation with him had been so
delicately done that it could hardly bear that
name.  Puzzled and savage at the change in her
he turned back to Haidee, but Haidee had her
pride that wrestled with her poor little crushed love
and for the time at least conquered it.  She would
not be left and again taken at will.  She retired
behind a sullen scowl.  Sacha, for once, was at a
loose end and did not like it a bit.</p>
<p class="pnext">Arrived at the <em class="italics">vieille église</em>, the two cousins
climbed cautiously up the crumbling walls, Rupert
with the string handle of the cement pot between
his teeth.  The rest of the party, scattered on the
sloping cliff-side in the mother-of-pearl moonlight,
sat watching them.  Below, the sea, a star-spangled
mirror, stretched from France to where
Alderney humped against the sky-line.  On the
Jersey coast a powerful light winked spasmodically.
The sky, clear in the east, was flecked overhead
and in the west with tiny snatches of snowy cloud,
regular as knitted stitches, or the scales on a
mackerel's back.</p>
<p class="pnext">Softly the Comtesse began to sing to them:</p>

<p class="pfirst">"Ah!" she sighed softly in the silence that
followed her song.  "And now we all go back to
Paris!  That dear Paris!  <em class="italics">C'est comme un amant
qu'il faut quitter pour un revoir plus chaud, et
comme tout neuf</em>!  If you do not budge from it,
it becomes like a husband, fatiguing and <em class="italics">exigeant</em>,
who makes you work too much and never gives
you room to breathe.  But----" she gazed
ecstatically towards Alderney in which direction
the lieutenant and Rupert happened to be sitting.
"Go away for a little while and you find yourself
dreaming of the sweet suffocating embrace that
exalts the veins----"</p>
<p class="pnext">"How white the sea looks!" suddenly broke in
Val.  It troubled her to see how Haidee hung
upon the pretty immodest phrases that slipped
so easily from Christiane de Vervanne's lips.
"What were those lines of yours, Sacha, about
when the sea is milk-white and Jersey black as
ink and a storm coming to-morrow?"</p>
<blockquote>
<div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line">"Quand la mer est comme le lait, et Jersey tout noir</div>
<div class="line">On peut attendre un orage avant demain soir,"</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="pfirst">quoted Sacha sulkily.</p>
<p class="pnext">The Comtesse shot an icy glance at Val.  She
did not like her rhapsodies interrupted.</p>
<p class="pnext">"<em class="italics">Épatant</em>, that woman!" she murmured to her
cavalry-man.</p>
<p class="pnext">On the walk home Sacha tried once more to
re-arrange the order of the party and get Val to
himself, but pitilessly she left him to the mercy
of Haidee, furious and vengeful as a Gorgon.
When they reached home it would have been
hard to say whose was the crossest-looking of their
two faces.  Trinkling back farewells, the Shai-poo
party continued on its way down the <em class="italics">Terrasse</em>,
but Sacha stayed.  He had gripped Val's hand
over the little fence that enclosed the yard and
would not let it go.</p>
<p class="pnext">"I must speak to you," he said urgently,
fiercely, and did not care that Haidee lingered
within earshot, and when she heard his words
started, then tore up the flight of steps into the
villa.</p>
<p class="pnext">"What is it, Sacha?" said Val, gently.</p>
<p class="pnext">"You have been playing with me!"  He was
white-lipped and furious.  She felt ashamed though
her intention had been good.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Oh, Sacha!--do not be angry!  Surely you too
were playing?--I----"</p>
<p class="pnext">"No!" he shot out at her.  "It was not play
for me--I----"</p>
<p class="pnext">But she would have no declarations.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Well--I am truly sorry--you must forgive
me--I, am very fond of you, Sacha--both you
and Rupert--but you must not think--Why, I am
a very serious woman.  Think, I have a son, and
am almost old enough to be your mother!"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Why did you not say that to me before?
Why have you been to me these last weeks so
full of allure, so <em class="italics">attirant</em>?" he asked savagely.
"Sapristi! you have been fooling me.  It has
pleased you to play with my heart!"</p>
<p class="pnext">She thought it the wisest thing then to tell him
the flat ungentle truth.</p>
<p class="pnext">"As it pleased you to play with Haidee's."</p>
<p class="pnext">He glared at her, and she stood staring steadily
back, the light of battle in her eye.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Haidee is only a child--her heart is very tender
and romantic.  I could not have its first bloom
rubbed off by you, Sacha--a sophisticated
Frenchman who would laugh and go on your way.  She
is too good for that."</p>
<p class="pnext">He breathed hard.</p>
<p class="pnext">"So!"  He muttered at last, "That is it?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Yes, that is it."  There was a silence.  Then
she said gently:</p>
<p class="pnext">"And in your heart you do not blame me, Sacha.
Think if it had been your little sister, and you had
seen her trying to waste her heart's first freshness
foolishly, uselessly.  What would you have done?
I know well enough what you would have done."</p>
<p class="pnext">"You had no right to play----" he began, but
he was softened.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Oh yes, every right.  Haidee is like my little
sister."</p>
<p class="pnext">She put her left hand over the gate and laid it on
the one which gripped her right.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Come!  There are no bones broken, Sacha.
You know very well that you do not really care
about me.  This was just one of the little
experiences of which you will have scores in your life;
the remembrance of it may help you in others.  But
I have not found it uninteresting.  You are a
charming and attractive fellow--if I did not happen to
be immune--(this was sheer guile on her part, but
honey has a great healing quality in such cases).
I assure you that I have found it anything but
an uninteresting experience.  Will you not pay
me the same compliment and shake hands on it?"</p>
<p class="pnext">After a little pause he let go his grip of her
right hand and took the other into a more gentle
grasp.  The scowl passed from his face.  He
was not a bad-hearted fellow--only one of his
kind!  A smile came into his hard blue eyes.</p>
<p class="pnext">"<em class="italics">B'en</em>!  All rite," he accepted, and kissed her
hand, not without a show of grace.</p>
<p class="pnext">Val sighed as she went softly indoors, and a pain
shot through her breast as she came upon Haidee
in the sitting-room, head on the table, hair spread
in every direction, absolute abandonment in her
pose.  A longing seized Val to sit down and put
her arm round the girl's waist, but she knew
Haidee too well to succumb to it.  Instead, she
pretended to notice nothing unusual.</p>
<p class="pnext">"A headache, chicken?" she asked casually,
and went to hang her hat behind the door.  At
the sound of her voice Haidee sprang up and stood
facing her.</p>
<p class="pnext">"I hate you--I hate you--" she cried
passionately.  "You always take away the people I
love from me!"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Oh, Haidee!" cried Val, sorrowfully, suddenly
remembering the night she had found the child
on Westenra's bed.</p>
<p class="pnext">"I hate you!" she screamed in concentrated
rage, her face dark with passion.  "I will hurt
you some day.  You'll see!"</p>
<p class="pnext">She flung out of the room.</p>
<p class="pnext">"So that is my reward for putting up with that
silly ass for three weeks!" said Val to herself, and
sighed once more.  Wearily she lighted her candle
and went to warm her heart with a glimpse of her
son.  He lay flung on the pillow like a warm pink
rose.  She burrowed her nose gently into his soft
neck, scenting the lovely puppy dog scent that
all young things have round their throats,
scenting, too, the little stinky hands that in his
yearning for bed he had only half-washed.  With a wet
sponge and some drops of eau-de-cologne she
gently removed from them the mingled odour of
shell-fish, bread and jam, and night dews.  Then
she made the sign of the Cross over him, and
went to bed.</p>
<div class="center transition">
<p class="pfirst">――――</p>
</div>
<p class="pfirst">The mackerel sky had not lied!  The next
morning was all glittering with sunlight under a
steel blue sky swept clear by a September wind
that tore up the sea and sent it pounding in great
grey-green walls with spittering spraying tops to
crash upon the shore.  They were delicious to
jump in, those great tawny breakers, and carried
the jumper fifteen or twenty feet high before they
hurled themselves with a roaring swish to cream
along the beach.  It was not a day to venture out
far.  Even good swimmers in such a sea contented
themselves with going in only up to the armpits,
waiting for the breaker to gather them up, then
pass and leave them in flat, clear water ready for
the next.</p>
<p class="pnext">The Comtesse and Celine, tired from their
journey the day before, sat and looked on, but
Rupert, Val, Haidee, and Sacha, with half a dozen
others, were in the water jumping like maniacs,
diving through sheer solid green walls, disappearing
under avalanches of foam, gasping, laughing,
panting.  Sometimes short, wild screams, almost
as of terror, were jerked out of them as the breaker
moved on them like some monster determined on
destruction.</p>
<p class="pnext">"<em class="italics">Quelle courage!</em>" said Christiane de Vervanne
wonderingly.  "And did you ever see anything
like Madame Valdana screaming and jumping
like a mad thing!  She behaves with a great
curiousness at times, that lady!"</p>
<p class="pnext">"She is an original!" said Celine, who was fond
of Val, and felt for her none of the antagonism
which the generality of Frenchwomen, in spite of
the <em class="italics">entente cordiale</em> and Edward the Peacemaker,
always will feel for Englishwomen.  True, Val
was not English, but Celine was unaware of the fact.</p>
<p class="pnext">In time Val gave Haidee the signal to come out.
They had been in quite half an hour, the breakers
appeared to be getting worse, and the wind had
turned bitterly cold.  Every one but the members
of their party had already left the water.  The
Frenchmen, however, Sacha, Rupert, and the
young officer, were disinclined to come out.
Instead it seemed as though with the departure of
the ladies they felt free to go farther in.  Val
stood in the creaming froth watching them for a
moment before she raced Haidee to the cabins.</p>
<p class="pnext">"I wish they would n't," she said uneasily, and
suddenly threw out her voice in a coo-ee.</p>
<p class="pnext">"<em class="italics">Venez</em>!  <em class="italics">Venez</em>, you boys!  You've been in
long enough!"</p>
<p class="pnext">The laugh and shout in Sacha's voice that came
blowing back seemed to be snatched by the waves
and torn to ribbons by the wind before it reached
the beach.  Val found herself shivering, and ran
for the cabins.  Just as she was dressed she
heard a scream, and looking through the diamond-shaped
hole in the door, saw Celine standing up
stripping off her clothes to her knickerbockers,
while the Comtesse stood by screaming and
wringing her hands.  A moment later every one
was pouring out of the cabins, and Val and Haidee
back in their wet bathing suits were running down
to the water's edge.  Only two heads were
bobbing in the waves--the third had disappeared!</p>
<div class="center transition">
<p class="pfirst">――――</p>
</div>
<p class="pfirst">It was nearly half an hour later when they
brought Sacha Lorrain's body to the beach.  The
delay came of no one knowing where he went down.
Only Celine had seen the wave hit him full in the
face and knock him backwards stunned, but when,
followed by Val and Haidee, she swam out to the
spot she had marked with her mind's eye, he was
not there.  They dived and swam under water
all round the place.  In that rough sea, with
the waves growing every moment more violent
and blinding, and churning up the sands, they
could scarcely see a yard before them under water.
And of course every moment was of value.  Some
one had run to the <em class="italics">digue</em> to get the lifeboat
manned; some one else to Villa Duval for hot
bottles.  Azalie, her harsh face grown amazingly
soft, stood laden with blankets.  Fishermen joined
the searchers in the water.  Fishwives walked up
and down the beach wringing their hands.</p>
<p class="pnext">"The General's son!  The Admiral's grandson!
Monsieur Sacha!"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Only the other day he was a <em class="italics">petit gars</em> in his
sailor's suit.  It was my man who taught him to
swim."</p>
<p class="pnext">"He made his first communion the same day as
my Jean!"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Ah!  The gay eyes he had!"</p>
<p class="pnext">Before they found him every one from the
village was grouped on the beach.  Sacha's
father--General Lorrain--the curé, the doctor, the mayor.
All stood waiting with strained, fearful faces,
while the boat pulled up and down, battered by
the waves.  The swimmers exhausted would come
up to rest in the surf, then enter again.  The
sunshine had gone, and the storm Sacha had prophesied
the night before was creeping like a black beast
across the horizon.  It was a sailor in the lifeboat
who spied the body at last, and diving down into
the water heaved it over the side.  Then they
pushed the boat in through the surf, and poor
Sacha was taken out and laid on the sands he had
trodden so blithely an hour before.</p>
<p class="pnext">After the first half an hour every one knew there
was no hope, though none voiced the knowledge.
People just stood in silent groups a little way off
from the central group that knelt, and swayed, and
jerked and moved unceasingly.  Rupert, white and
exhausted, wrapped in his bathing toga, walked
up and down the beach, stopping every now and
then to try and get Celine away, but Celine would
not come.  She was rubbing Sacha's feet, and
staring, staring at his cold, calm face.  Every now
and then she would say imploringly:</p>
<p class="pnext">"Listen, Sacha!  Sacha, my brother!  <em class="italics">Veux tu
écoute?</em>"</p>
<p class="pnext">The General, very calm and stern-faced, stood
at the head of the group.  But sometimes he
would go away suddenly and walk swiftly up and
down with Rupert, for a moment or two, his head
high, the little ribbon of honour a red dot on his
upright breast, then return to look down again at
the still, still face of his only son.  He could do
nothing.  The operations were in the hands of
competent men.  The doctor from Barleville had
come rushing in his motor to reinforce the
Mascaret doctor.  Val, when she was dressed, sat
on a rock with her arms round Bran, and could
not bear to see the General's eyes.  Haidee and
Christiane de Vervanne were crouched close by.</p>
<p class="pnext">All the sailors and lifeboatmen were acquainted
with the business of resuscitation, and there was
no lack of relays.  When one batch of men wearied
another took its place.  But all was in vain.
The body of Sacha Lorrain lay there, very gallant
in its youth and beauty, but his soul was gone
beyond recall, and</p>

<p class="pfirst">It had always been understood that after the
summer Haidee was to go back to Paris to
finish her education at the Versailles Lycée, while
Val and Bran put in another healthy, if desolate
winter at Mascaret.  Now the latter part of the
plan was impossible.  The place was haunted, for
Val, by poor Sacha's ghost.  She knew not where
to go except it were back to Paris.  Bran was older
now and his health established.  Perhaps if she
could find a governess for him he would get along
all right while she worked!  The need for work
was imperative.  Funds were down to zero.  She
knew not where to turn for money, except where
nothing but the prospect of starvation for Bran
would let her turn--to the Credit Lyonnais where
lay the accumulating quarterly sums from
Westenra.</p>
<p class="pnext">So when the time came for Haidee to make
her entrance at the Lycée, Bran and Val returned
to Paris as well: the latter having written and
re-engaged her old studio which was to let furnished.</p>
<p class="pnext">Haidee was a changed girl.  She seemed to have
grown years older and hard as a stone.  She had
withdrawn herself from all intimacy with Val, and
was even cold and harsh in her manner to Bran,
who could not understand and was always saying
wistfully:</p>
<p class="pnext">"Don't you love me any more, Haidee?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Of course I do," she would answer impatiently.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Then why do you look at me as if you 'd like to
spank me on my tailie?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Oh, don't worry me, Bran.  You make me tired!"</p>
<p class="pnext">Mascaret seemed suddenly to have grown old
and grey.  A great coldness had settled upon the
little village.  Bitter winds swept every leaf from
the trees and the sun was hidden in wet mists.
The Villa Shai-poo, its flagstaff bare, its windows
shuttered and barred, looked like a bereaved
brooding mother folding arms on her grief.  The
occupants of Villa Duval were the last of the
visitors to leave the village.  Even Sacha had gone.
His people had taken him back to Paris to lie in
the family vault at Père La Chaise.</p>
<p class="pnext">From Mascaret to Paris is an eight hours'
journey on the worst line in France, and when
they reached St. Lazare Station late in the
afternoon they were all tired out, with hearts as heavy
as lead.  Val left Bran on Haidee's lap in the
waiting-room while she went to unlock the trunks
in the Customs' shed.  There were crowds of
travellers and loads of baggage to be gone through,
for the boat-train from Cherbourg was just in also.
Val, very weary, sat on the low table waiting, and
staring about her with sad eyes full of trouble.
Suddenly, standing quite near, she saw a face she
knew.  She could not immediately place the man
in her memory but she was so sure of knowing him
that she smiled and gave a little nod.  Immediately
he took off his hat and approached.</p>
<p class="pnext">"I think you <em class="italics">almost</em> remember, Mrs. Valdana,
but not quite," he said.  The moment she heard
his voice she placed him.  It was the French Jew
who had sat next her on board the <em class="italics">Bavaric</em>.</p>
<p class="pnext">"How do you do, Mr. Bernstein!" she said
cordially, extending her hand.  It was as though
she had met an old friend.  A look of keen
pleasure came into his shrewd face.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Such a memory must be a treasure to you as a
journalist!"</p>
<p class="pnext">"A journalist!"  The words sounded strange in
her ears.  How many years ago since she was a
journalist!  Since she first met this man!  A far
absorbed look came into her eyes.</p>
<p class="pnext">"I knew you in a minute," he said.  "You have
not changed at all, only grown a little"--("sadder,"
he was going to say, but substituted)--"younger."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Ah! you have not changed either," she said dryly.</p>
<p class="pnext">"You have even the same beautiful chain on
you!  I hope you have not forgotten your promise
to give me first refusal if ever you want to
sell it?"</p>
<p class="pnext">A startled look flashed across her face.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Ah, yes!  My chain!  You did say that,
did n't you?"  She stared at him meditatively.
"What do you really think it is worth?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"It would be hard to say right here."  He had
grown extremely American in accent and speech.
"But if you would call and see me with it.  Are
you staying in Paris?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Yes."</p>
<p class="pnext">He got out a card.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Well, here is my office address--<em class="italics">Rue de Bach</em>.
Call any time you like, but soon, as I am off to
England again in three days."</p>
<p class="pnext">"I will come to-morrow," she said.  "In the
meantime, would n't it be a good thing for you
to take the necklace with you and examine it?"</p>
<p class="pnext">She detached it from her neck with some little
difficulty, for the clasp was a firm one, and held it
out.  The Jew looked at her with eyes in which for
a moment there hovered a shade of something like
pity that quickly turned to pleasure.  A faint
flush came into his face, and as he took the
necklace he pressed her hand warmly.  In America
where he had been for the past five years such a
trusting spirit as Val's was not met with every
day in the week, and the <em class="italics">rencontre</em> refreshed his
jaded Hebraic heart like wine.</p>
<p class="pnext">"You <em class="italics">just</em> come," he said cordially, "and I bet
I 'll have something good to tell you."</p>
<p class="pnext">Immediately afterwards she was called to open
her luggage, and bade him good-bye, telling him
that she had some one waiting for her.</p>
<p class="pnext">All the way of the long drive across Paris, she
sat cogitating the question of the necklace.  Even
if it turned out to be of value, ought she to part
with it?  Would ill luck come to her for parting
with her mother's mascot?  Could any worse luck
than she already had, come to her, she began to
ask herself in irony?  Then she stopped and flung
her arms round Bran.  Yes; yes.  Ill luck can
always come to mothers.  Mothers are never safe--nor
fathers!  She thought of Sacha lying still
on the beach, and of that stern look on his father's
face!</p>
<p class="pnext">"Oh God!  What are necklaces? ... what is
money? ... what is anything against that
pain?" she cried in her heart, and held Bran so
tightly that he gave a yelp.  Haidee, as always
now, sat wrapt in a sullen reserve.  Neither by
look nor word did she exhibit the faintest
sympathy for any troubles but her own.  The only
thing that seemed to interest her was the
prospect of getting away from Val and Bran to her
new life at school.  It chilled Val's heart to have
one who had been so close turn away from her
thus.  Even worse it was to see Bran's dear little
efforts to be kind and friendly, snubbed.  Every
rebuff to him was like a blow in the face to Val.
But she would not blame Haidee: the child was
dear to Westenra.  Besides she <em class="italics">was</em> only a child,
and had suffered through Sacha's death.  The
shock of it coming on top of her wounded pride
and little lost love-dream was enough to embitter
her, thought Val, and blamed herself for ever
having interfered.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Such things are safe in God's hands!  He takes
care of children and drunkards.  Who am I to
have arrogated His rights?"</p>
<p class="pnext">But Haidee's attitude acutely added to the
misery and uncertainty of life at this time, and in
the dusky shadows of the cab as it rumbled over
to the Latin Quarter, Val held her boy's head
against her breast and slow tears stole down her
face and were drawn in between her lips, drying
her throat with their salty flavour.  Life too tasted
salt and acrid.  It seemed to her that in everything
she had put her hand to she had failed and
fallen short.</p>
<p class="pnext">At <em class="italics">rue Campaigne première</em> the concierge almost
embraced them, so delighted was she to see them
again.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Many people have been looking for Madame
and wishing her back," she announced.  "Not only
artists but persons very <em class="italics">chic</em> also have been to call."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Locusts!" said Val to herself.  "Locusts and
devourers all!"  She knew those <em class="italics">chic</em> ones well.
People who would not work themselves and could
not bear to see others achieving.  All artists have
this class to contend with.</p>
<p class="pnext">"I told every one you would be back this week.
I know you owe no one money, and are not afraid,
like some artists, of visitors," said the concierge
cheerfully, and Val gave a groan.  She resolved
to be up early the next day and take Haidee off to
school before there was a chance of meeting any
early-fliers.</p>
<p class="pnext">Before she went to bed, however, she unpacked
her papers and found a little old parchment letter
which dealt with the gift to her mother of the
comfort necklace.  It was written in Russian
and neither she nor her mother had ever had the
curiosity to have it translated, but Iolita had
always been careful to preserve it, and it had
marvellously survived all Val's many packings and
wanderings.  She now sealed it up and forwarded it
to Bernstein on the vague chance of its being of use
in the valuation of the necklace.</p>
<p class="pnext">At seven in the morning she received a <em class="italics">petit bleu</em>
from him, evidently sent off the night before, but
posted after tea, asking her to call without fail
at three o'clock that afternoon.  Immediately she
sent out her <em class="italics">femme de ménage</em> to see if Bran's old
governess, the young American girl, could take
charge of him for the day, giving him lunch and tea
at her mother's home.  That matter satisfactorily
settled, she started for the Gare Montparnasse
with Haidee, en route for Versailles.  It took the
whole morning to settle Haidee in, pay her bills,
and talk over with the Directrice her future course
of study.  Asked to lunch with the girls at the
Lycée she would not stay.  It was no pleasure to
be with Haidee while she preserved that sullen,
resentful manner.  Life was grim enough!  So
Val took lunch in a little <em class="italics">crémerie</em> in the avenue
de Paris, and returned to Paris by tram to the
<em class="italics">Pont Royal</em>, where she dismounted and took a bus
to Bernstein's number in the <em class="italics">Rue de Bach</em>.</p>
<p class="pnext">He received her with a manner full of some
suppressed excitement which quickly communicated
itself to her.</p>
<p class="pnext">"You have something to tell me?" she said,
trembling with she knew not what fear.  She had
almost forgotten the necklace.  With her curious
sense of prevision it was revealed to her in some
way that for the moment the Jew was arbiter of
her destiny.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Sit down," he said, pushing a comfortable
chair towards her.  "I want you to tell me the
history of the necklace."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Oh, as to that, Mr. Bernstein, I know very
little.  My mother gave it to me when she died.
She had always worn it, ever since I can remember.
She loved the beautiful little pictures, and she had
an idea that it was not only a mascot against
extreme poverty but also that it possessed some
healing power in sickness.  Many times when we
were very poor indeed she was asked by people
who liked curious things to sell it, but she never
would.  She always remembered that the old
Russian man who gave it to her told her that in the
day of trouble it would bring comfort to her and
hers.  He was a strange old man who lived in
exile in Spain.  He had committed some political
crime and had fled from Russia; was very wealthy
but lived with great simplicity in quite a poor
part of Seville, and it was there that he made great
friends with my mother and her father, who was
blind but had been a great adventurer and soldier
of fortune.  The old Russian grew to love my
mother--every one who knew my mother loved
her.  And one day he gave her the necklace.  She
took it because it was so pretty and yet did not
seem very valuable.  She never took jewels from
people, though of course many were offered her,
as to all dancers.  But this man was very old and
gentle and his gift seemed simple too.  Only, he
strangely insisted on giving her, with it, that paper
which I sent you last night.  That was to show
that it was a deed of gift, and no one could take
it from her.  But no one ever tried.  He was
assassinated a year or two later and all his papers
and jewels mysteriously stolen, but my mother had
left Spain then and was in London and no one
ever claimed the necklace.  She loved it and I
love it.  It hardly seems to me, Mr. Bernstein, after
talking about it that I can part with it after all."  She
took it up and fingered the glowing, luminous
beads tenderly.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Not even for seventy-five thousand pounds!"
he said quietly.</p>
<p class="pnext">"What!" She stared at him.  She thought he
had gone mad.</p>
<p class="pnext">"That is what I offer you," he said in a
business-like tone.</p>
<p class="pnext">"But...?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"They are pearls of the first quality."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Pearls!"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Yes, the pale green colour is only a clever
coating of paint that can be removed easily by the
use of a certain spirit.  Look here where I have
worked at this one a little--I had to, you know,
in order to be certain.  I have n't harmed the
painting."</p>
<p class="pnext">He showed her a bead that had a picture of a
desert on it, with tiny palms waving, and a
primitive well.  From the back of this he had removed
the pale green colouring and there instead glowed
the rich ivory-grey thick yet luminous substance
of the pearl.</p>
<p class="pnext">"I was pretty certain of it from the first, that
is why I was so keen.  It is one of the most
wonderful necklaces the world has ever seen.  It once
belonged to the Russian royal family--as your old
man in Seville did.  He knew what he was doing
when he gave it to your mother, and when he
wrote out that paper, which was a deed of gift,
witnessed by his old Chinese servant and the
Russian consul.  I had it translated first thing
this morning.  It will hold good in a court of law.
It was the Chinese servant who painted the
pictures on the pearls to hide and disguise them, and
by Gee! he was an artist, that fellow.  Only a
trained eye like mine would have suspected the
truth.  And let me tell you, Mrs. Valdana, with
any one but you I should have made use of my
knowledge to my own advantage.  It is my
business to do so.  Every business man is entitled
to make use of the ignorance of those he deals
with.  That is business training, <em class="italics">we</em> have learned
it and paid for it, the other party has n't.  It is
like a doctor's fees.  You pay him because he
knows better than you.  He has been in training
for years, and paid with his mind and his soul for
that training, while you have been busy with other
things--training in another direction perhaps.
Well, the time comes when you need his training
and you pay for it."</p>
<p class="pnext">"I understand," said Val quietly.</p>
<p class="pnext">He laughed.</p>
<p class="pnext">"No, you don't understand at all.  You could
never understand such a method.  You have
never got the best of any one in your life.  That
is why I am not going to use my method in your
case.  But I can tell you," he added with a grim
smile, "it is a unique case.  I never did such
a thing before in my life and never will again.  It
is a good thing after all that there are not many
people like you in the world, Mrs. Valdana.
Jewellers with hearts might be ruined."</p>
<p class="pnext">"It is very kind of you, but I can't accept this
sacrifice of your interests," said Val, stammering
a little, very embarrassed and uncomfortable.  "I
couldn't dream of accepting it," she added firmly.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Don't worry--skip," said he laughing.  "My
sacrifice is only comparative.  At the worst I
stand to make anything between five to twenty-five
thousand pounds out of the deal."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Are you sure?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Dead sure--seventy-five thousand pounds
sure," he said dryly.  "My philanthropy does n't
run to such risks as that.  It only means that if
you had n't happened to be <em class="italics">you</em>, it would have been
I who took seventy-five and the rest and you who
got the speculative twenty-five."</p>
<p class="pnext">"I think you are too kind," she said.  "I don't
know how to thank you."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Don't try," he said blithely.  "It will be a
good deal all round, and everybody happy.
That old Russian knew something when he told
your mother to put it by for a day of need.  Now
I am going to fix the matter instantly and give
you a cheque for half the amount on the Bank of
France.  The rest you shall have to-morrow.  Sit
down while I get busy."</p>
<p class="pnext">She asked him to make out a clear statement of
the sale, price, etc., and to give it to her.  She had
a special purpose in this.  In the act of writing he
looked up suddenly.</p>
<p class="pnext">"By the way, talking of doctors, do you
remember a man called Westenra who was on board the
<em class="italics">Bavaric</em>?"  He looked at her keenly, for he
remembered very well the talk of her interest in
that same man.  But of the truth he had no inkling.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Yes," she said slowly.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Well, what do you think?  I got
appendicitis in New York last May, and my partner, who
is an American, said to me, 'There is only one
man for you, and he is the best man in New York;
come along to his nursing home.'  And when
I got there who was his famous guy but our man
from the <em class="italics">Bavaric</em>!  What do you think of that?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"I knew he was a surgeon," said Val evenly.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Well, I tell you, I was surprised.  He did me
up bully.  He 's got a fine place there in 68th
Street.  A tip-top show; everything running on
wheels.  And a corking, handsome girl that he 's
going to marry, at the head of things."</p>
<p class="pnext">He applied himself to his writing.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Is he not married already?" said Mrs. Valdana,
and he thought, as he had often thought
before, what a strange melancholy cadence her
voice possessed.</p>
<p class="pnext">"A widower, I believe.  The nurses told me so
at any rate.  You know what jolly gossips they
are.  But Miss Holland is a cut above the
ordinary American nurse, that's why they 're so
jealous of her, I guess, and ready to say that she 's
been after the doctor for years, and only made a
success of the place because of that.  And why
not, I say?  That's what most women make a
success of things for, isn't it, Mrs. Valdana--some
fellow?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Or a failure of things!" said Mrs. Valdana,
following some train of thought of her own.
There was a deeper melancholy in her voice, and
he thought how tired and ill she looked.</p>
<p class="pnext">"You ought to get away for a change, Mrs. Valdana,"
he said, when he handed her the cheque
and shook hands in farewell.  "You look like a
woman who 's come to the end of her tether."</p>
<p class="pnext">She felt like it too.  She went home like a
woman who has heard the sentence of death
pronounced upon her.  In the Metro she lay back
in her corner with closed eyes and whispered to
herself.</p>
<p class="pnext">"What is the good?  What is the good?  Oh,
that one might let go--lay it all down and go to
rest!"</p>
<p class="pnext">But she knew she could not.  There are always
ropes to bind the hopeless ones fast to life--to pull
them forth from the shadows back to the bleak
grey road of life.  Bran was her rope.</p>
<p class="pnext">At the concierge's lodge she was informed that
several visitors had called and gone, but one, more
persistent, waited for her on her landing.</p>
<p class="pnext">"He has been many times, poor soul," said she,
"and one has not the heart to refuse him entrance.
I think he is one of those whom Art has been too
much for."</p>
<p class="pnext">Val hardly heard her.  A sort of numb dulness
that had taken possession of her prevented her
from feeling anything but a passing vexation that
she might not be alone; heavily she climbed the
stair and came at last to the door.  A tall loose
figure in grey tweeds rose up at her from the
doorstep.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Val!  Will you forgive me for dogging you
like this?" said a humble trembling voice she did
not know.  She had to peer into his face and
examine him before it dawned upon her that it was
Horace Valdana.</p>
<div class="center transition">
<p class="pfirst">――――</p>
</div>
<p class="pfirst">"How did you find me?" she said dully.  He
was sitting doubled up in the most comfortable
chair in the studio.  But there was no comfort
in his face or attitude.  His arms, pressed in a
curious way against his stomach, seemed holding
something there that hurt him.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Bribed one of Branker Preston's office boys."</p>
<p class="pnext">This simple statement was in keeping with all
the rest he had uttered within the last hour.
The man was changed.  He was finished with
lying and subterfuge because life had finished with
him--or was finishing rapidly.  The hand of
death was on him at last, there could be no
mistake about it this time.  His doom was dight.
He had lied and lied, but nothing he could now
say availed, for his face told the truth.  He was
doomed, and by some strange act of justice the
fell disease that had him in its grip was the very
one he had only pretended to have years before
when playing for her sympathy and money.</p>
<p class="pnext">And Val, during that hour in which she sat
listening to him not so much pleading his cause
as merely stating his case in all its hideous
pitifulness, came to the decision that she had no longer
right nor reason for withholding such help as he
begged.  It had been a black, terrible hour.</p>
<p class="pnext">Not less so because she was really touched by the
look of suffering on his face, by those spasmodic
jerks of his arms, and that habit of holding fast to
something within that ate like a rat at his vitals,
while sweat broke out on his forehead and a grey
agony passed ghostlike across his face.  Her
heart could never harden itself against suffering,
and she came nearer in those moments to forgetting
the wrongs Valdana had worked upon her than
ever before.</p>
<p class="pnext">And it looked uncommonly like her duty to
forgive this man and take care of him now that he so
urgently needed it.  There was no one else in the
world to do it.  For his mother was dead, and his
secret buried with her.  She had died very
suddenly, the end doubtless brought on by the
dreadful anxiety of having to carry that same secret
unshared.  Such provision as she could secretly
make for him she had made, but it was only a slight
one, and Valdana had long been at the end of his
resources.</p>
<p class="pnext">"And if you turn me down, Val, and you have
every right to, I shan't blame you a bit.  I shall
see what the Seine can do for me--though I 'd
rather it had been the old Thames."</p>
<p class="pnext">A better man would have given the river first
refusal perhaps, but Valdana had never set up for
a hero, and was not going to begin now.</p>
<p class="pnext">In the end her decision was clinched as often
happens by something outside herself.  A terrible
spasm seized him, doubling him up right there
before her, turning him grey, and jerking a groan
of agony from the very depths of him.  A fit
of shivering succeeded, and it was plain that the
man was not fit to be up and about.  His place
was in bed, under medical supervision.</p>
<p class="pnext">With decision came energy, and in a few
moments she had him lying on the large divan in
which she and Bran were used to sleep, covered
up, and a steaming cup of tea inside him.  Then
she ran downstairs to the concierge's lodge and
telephoned for a doctor.  Afterwards she sent
round to Bran's governess to ask them to keep
him for the night.  They were good responsible
people, and she knew that she could trust them
with her child--for a night at least, until she
knew what further was to be done.</p>
<p class="pnext">The doctor suggested a hospital; such a case, he
said, needed constant nursing and care.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Unless you are well enough off to have a nurse
to help you," and he tried not to look doubtfully
around him at the big bare studio, "I should
think you had better try and get rid of the
responsibility of this hopeless case by putting him
into one of the English or American hospitals
here.  You are American, are n't you?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"I have plenty of money," said Val, leaving his
question unanswered, "and am quite able to have
help in nursing him here.  Please give me full
instructions and information."</p>
<p class="pnext">The doctor looked surprised, and more so when,
after he had examined Valdana, she paid him his
fee and took down the address of the best cancer
specialist in Paris.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Not that he can do any good.  The case is too
far advanced for operation--even I can tell you
that.  But he will be able to give the best
treatment for alleviation until the end comes--that
won't be long, I expect."</p>
<p class="pnext">And the great specialist could do no more (as
is more often the case than people guess) than
confirm the verdict of the ordinary practitioner.</p>
<p class="pnext">"A matter of months!" he said.  "And they
will be bad months--for others beside the patient.
You had better send him to a hospital."</p>
<p class="pnext">But Val shook her head.  She had determined to
accept this duty that was so clear to her; and there
was money now to ease the way.  Seventy-five
thousand pounds!  How neatly that sum had
been inserted into the gap of circumstance by the
clever hand of Fate!</p>

<p class="pfirst">"Yes; she is very droll, your <em class="italics">belle-maman</em>," said
the Comtesse de Vervanne.  "To live in
three <em class="italics">ateliers</em>!  That is <em class="italics">fantastique</em>!  Three big
wide <em class="italics">ateliers</em>! one for herself, one for the little
Bran, and one other for--<em class="italics">who</em>?  Who is it that
dwells in the third <em class="italics">atelier</em> across the landing,
Haidee, my very dear?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Don't ask <em class="italics">me</em>," said Haidee sulkily, yet with
alert eyes, for she was unable to contain her
curiosity and amazement at the news.  Val with
three studios, who on their return to Paris had not
possessed the price of a quarter's rent for one!
And according to Madame de Vervanne they were
big studios--no mere holes in the wall with
skylights let in the ceiling.  Parquet floors,
beautifully shaded walls, wide galleries and French
windows that led into balconies!  It sounded like an
Arabian tale.  Haidee knew, as she knew most
practical everyday things, how the rents of studios
ranged, and she computed that the rent of such a
one as the Comtesse described ran into not a
centime less than three thousand francs a year.
And Val with three!  But the thing was
incomprehensible, <em class="italics">impayable</em>--fantastic indeed as the
Comtesse described it!</p>
<p class="pnext">She was aware from the new address forwarded
to her that Val had removed to the Lamartine
Building in Boulevard Raspail, a great block of
newly finished and very elaborate studios, which
they in company with all the other hard-working
and poor artists of the Quarter had long made a
mock of, calling it the American Crystal Palace.
It had lifts, a roof garden, balconies, baths, and
all the luxuries that artists can never aspire to.
Haidee on seeing the changed address had
supposed that in the feeble condition of the family
finances Val had been obliged to take one or two
of the tiny rooms always to be let at the top of
most big mansions, and which are usually rented
out to domestics.  The idea was not displeasing
to Haidee.  In the frame of mind she had adopted
she liked to think of Val suffering discomfort and
poverty.  And she did not care either if Bran had
to undergo the same thing, because she knew that
if Bran's quarters were cramped Val would suffer
far more than for herself.  It will be seen that the
dark caves in Haidee's soul had taken unto
themselves infernal occupants, as dark caves will if
the sunshine of loving-kindness is not let into them
from day to day.  It actually irked her to hear
now from Christiane de Vervanne that Bran's
room was as big as a schoolroom.</p>
<p class="pnext">"About four times as big as this," said the
Comtesse, casting an appraising eye round
classroom B of the Pavilion Mauve.  "With shelves
all round, and an assortment of toys most wonderful.
Even I could find myself very much amused
with such toys.  He has a <em class="italics">foxe</em> too."</p>
<p class="pnext">"A fox!" shrieked Haidee.</p>
<p class="pnext">"But yes--one of the little black and white ones
with the tail of him cut off."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Oh, a fox-<em class="italics">terrier</em>."  Haidee turned away
impatiently, but curiosity obliged her to turn back
instantly to hear the rest of the amazing tale.</p>
<p class="pnext">"At one end of this big nursery studio two
white beds, one for the <em class="italics">petit</em> Bran and one for the
American governess who is permanently installed
and very devoted."</p>
<p class="pnext">"A governess to sleep with Bran!" exclaimed
Haidee.  "Oh, no, that is too strong.  I have
never known Val let Bran sleep out of her sight!"</p>
<p class="pnext">"But yes--it is all so <em class="italics">bizarre</em>.  You must go
home and see, my Haidee."</p>
<p class="pnext">Indeed Haidee registered a resolution to write
to Val that very night and ask for a <em class="italics">sortie</em> letter to
be sent for her to come home for the following
Saturday night and Sunday.  She was still hating
Val with a fierce hatred and had no desire to see
her.  But this was a thing that had got to be looked
into.</p>
<p class="pnext">"And," continued Madame de Vervanne, with
her amiable air of finding everything extremely
amusing, "who do I find installed in the studio of
Madame Valdana taking tea, indeed making tea,
as much at home as if he had collected the sticks
for it on the Mascaret beach, but--who do you
think, my Cabbage?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Goodness knows!" muttered the Cabbage.
"Val is mad."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Why, who but our <em class="italics">cher</em> Poulot, Rupert!"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Rupert!  She 's got <em class="italics">him</em>, now?" cried Haidee,
and her face darkened as definitely as if some one
had passed a blacking-brush over it.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Yes," said the Comtesse softly, reflectively.
"It is as you say.  First poor dear Sacha, now
the innocent Poulot.  Who next?"  She sighed.</p>
<p class="pnext">There was a little silence.  Then Haidee said:</p>
<p class="pnext">"Rupert has been twice to see me, once on
Sunday and once on Thursday."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Ah! and did he tell you how many times he
went to see Madame Valentine?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"No, indeed, and I don't care anyhow," was the
retort given with perhaps unnecessary fierceness.</p>
<p class="pnext">"But," cooed Madame soothingly, "one should
care a little, <em class="italics">chère</em> Haidee, for the sake of the poor
good Poulot.  She is no doubt a very fine lady, the
charming Mistress Valentine, but we do not wish
to see Rupert suffer as Sacha did."</p>
<p class="pnext">The subtle words bit into Haidee's heart like
acid on an old wound.  She had been very much
touched at the Comtesse's act in writing to the
Directrice for permission to call at the Lycée.
And it was very gratifying that Madame de
Vervanne should have arrived in a motor which also
contained a young lieutenant of Dragons in
uniform, and which stood growling and puffing at
the Lycée gates, filling all the girls with
excitement and envy.  Haidee's vanity too was greatly
flattered by the tender and confidential manner
of the older woman, who never forgot also to tell
her how pretty and clever she was and to give
recognition to the fact that she was now seventeen.
So different to Val's manner of treating her as
though she were still a child and quite unable to
arrange her own destiny.  A curious, fresh access
of fury was aroused in Haidee's breast by the
Comtesse's tale of Rupert's devotion to Val.
Rupert had been to see Haidee twice.  He was
stationed at Fontainebleau, doing his second year
of military service, and when he came to the Lycée
accompanied by his sister Celine he was wearing
the ordinary private soldier's uniform, and
looking very handsome in the gay red and blue.  All
the girls had admired him immensely, and Haidee
herself liked him extraordinarily better than in
Mascaret.  While Celine talked with some of the
girls she knew, Rupert and Haidee had wandered
about the gardens, talking about Sacha and little
incidents of their happy time together that now,
looked at from a little distance of time, seemed
wonderfully perfumed and beautified.  The
remembrance of these two walks with him made
Haidee burn with sudden indignation against Val.</p>
<p class="pnext">The Comtesse had begun to talk about other
things, made Haidee show her all round Pavilion
Mauve and the big roomy schoolhouse, then take
her out into the grounds, along the paths that
wound amongst other Pavilions, the Red, the
Blue, the Rose--and over broad lawns that in the
soft mild air of Versailles were green, even in
winter.  In the middle of one of the lawns was a
little lake bordered by strange-leaved dwarf-like
bushes that in summer were thick with crimson
flowers, but which now stretched out frail black
branches to the silent fountain.  Dead leaves
rustled and cracked under the Comtesse's
high-heeled shoes as they walked.  She waved her hand
at the well-kept tennis courts.</p>
<p class="pnext">"But you are charmingly well here!" she cried,
in her gay little soprano.  "Oh, to be young again
and lovely like you, my child!  Not all the
Mistress Valdanas could take away from me what I
wanted!"</p>
<p class="pnext">She returned meditatively to the former subject.</p>
<p class="pnext">"But who is it that resides in the third <em class="italics">atelier</em>
think you, Haidee?  Curiosity consumes and
burns me.  There is a door leading into it from
Madame's <em class="italics">atelier</em>.  Twice she left us to go swiftly
and return.  Once when the door opened I heard
a man cough.  Tell me?--it could not be the
mysterious papa returned, could it?"</p>
<p class="pnext">Haidee gazed at her blankly.</p>
<p class="pnext">"There <em class="italics">is</em> a mysterious papa, is it not?"  If the
curiosity of the Comtesse had not always been
pleasantly glossed by pretty childish gestures and
rippling laughter, it might have seemed vulgar.
Haidee was not clever enough to realise this, and
she was staggered by the whole strange story,
which sounded unlike Val in every detail, but even
in her amazement she was not going to confide to a
comparative stranger the tangled domestic history
of the family.  If she had no feeling but one of
resentment for Val, she could still be loyal to
Westenra.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Oh yes, there is a papa--Bran's papa of course,
and my guardian; but it would n't be him."</p>
<p class="pnext">"That makes even more <em class="italics">bizarre</em> the affair," said
the Comtesse lightly.  Then, knowing that she had
said enough for the time being, she dismissed the
subject and shortly afterwards departed with her
Dragon.</p>
<p class="pnext">As soon as she was gone Haidee, who was
nothing if not prompt, sat down and wrote to Val
for a <em class="italics">sortie</em> letter for the coming Sunday.  She
intended to investigate this mystery of the three
studios for herself--likewise the story of Rupert's
entanglement.</p>
<p class="pnext">But to her acute annoyance the opportunity
was not afforded her.  A letter from Val came
by return to the effect that she was too busy and
worried to be able to receive Haidee that term.
As a palliative she sent a parcel of books, an
enormous box of exquisite chocolates from Boissier's,
and a dozen tennis balls.  Haidee was a devotee
of tennis and always complained bitterly of the
lack of balls, for tennis balls are outrageously
expensive in France.  These Val sent were of the
best quality and must have cost at least three
francs each.  The mystery deepened.</p>
<div class="center transition">
<p class="pfirst">――――</p>
</div>
<p class="pfirst">During the bad time of worriment and weariness
with Valdana, Rupert was indeed a great
stay to Val.  Being stationed so close to Paris
he was able to come often to the Lamartine
Studios, and she was always glad to see the blue
friendly eyes that had in them some of the space
and compassion of sea and sky.  There was
something so loyal and reliable about him that
she had actually told him the truth about Valdana,
and been definitely aided by his sympathy and
understanding.  His influence was good, too,
for Bran, who was beginning to reach that stage
when the society and point of view of men means
a great deal in a boy's life.  And Bran had always
had a special <em class="italics">penchant</em> for boys and men.  It gave
Val many a sharp pang, not of resentment but of
sorrow, to observe in him a yearning for his father,
for she knew that whatever she was able to do for
her son, she could never assuage that longing,
never give him the masculine companionship and
influence of which he had been robbed.  It grieved
her terribly to think that in her son's life those
lovely pliable years, when bonds between father
and son are so simply but strongly fashioned from
the one's weakness and the other's strength,
were passing week by week, month by month.
Glad enough then was she that he had at least the
friendly brotherly affection and influence of so
clear-hearted a boy as Rupert.</p>
<p class="pnext">With Valdana she never allowed Bran to come
into contact.  Indeed, Valdana from the first
was practically oblivious to those about him.
His race was very nearly run.  He had come to
Val in the last lap of it, upheld by God knew what
strange resolution to make her share to the bitter
end their disastrous partnership.  Having found
her he seemed content to let life wreak her pitiless
worst on him before he was allowed to depart to
that death which he had once ignobly shirked,
but whose embrace he now longed for with the
ardour of a lover.  His sufferings, indeed, were
terrible.  In the centre of the great lofty room he
lay and wrestled with an agony that was almost
unceasing.  But he was well aware of being
surrounded and enfolded by every comfort.  Softened
light, flowers, music, good nursing, everything
that money and kindness could supply to alleviate
pain was at hand, and he knew he had Val to
thank, and vaguely wondered how she achieved
it, but did not care much as long as she was by his
bedside, in the pale blue linen overall she always
assumed as soon as she entered.  Cancer may or
may not be infectious--that is one of the problems
science has not yet solved--but with Bran so near
she took no risks, changing even her clothes on
entering and leaving the sick-room, which was
an entirely self-contained <em class="italics">appartement</em> and <em class="italics">atelier</em>.
She had been so fortunate as to obtain in the
newly-finished building the whole of the immense
floor of three studios.  It rejoiced her to be able
to give her Brannie one entirely to himself and his
governess.  That was one of the joys the seventy-five
thousand pounds had brought her.  She had
already spent some hundreds of it on furnishing
and the heavy expenses entailed by Valdana's
needs.  But the rest she had been wise enough
to allow the kindly Bernstein to invest for her, and
her mind was at rest at last and for the first time
in her life from the gnawing tooth of poverty.
She was doing no writing.  Not only was her
life, divided between Bran and the sick man, too
full for such a thing, but at last she could permit
herself the luxury of refraining from writing when
she had nothing to say.  That forced work in
Mascaret had sickened her soul.  Now she could
let her creative faculty rest for a while at least and
give undivided attention to this duty of hers to
Valdana.</p>
<p class="pnext">As for having Haidee home, it was out of the
question.  She felt herself unable to go into the
matter of her relation to Valdana with any one
so antagonistic to her as Haidee was at present.
She knew that the girl still cherished bitterness
against her for poor Sacha's defection, and she
could only hope that with the coming of other
interests, this feeling would pass away and allow a
return to the old footing of comradeship and
affection.  She let Haidee profit too by the necklace
windfall, sending her presents of music, books,
and the countless pretty trifles that girls set store
on.  Bran went weekly with his governess to see
her, and Rupert, urged by Val, went very often
too.  Rupert knew all about the affair of Sacha.
Not from Val, but because by a strange coincidence
Sacha had opened his heart to his cousin the night
before his death.  The two young men had shared
the same room at Shai-poo, and in the silences of
the night shared many confidences also.  That
was how Rupert had come to know the truth,
and to keep his reverence and affection for Val
unshaken.</p>
<p class="pnext">"I love the sea, I love the music of the violin,
and I love you--all with the same love," he told
her one day.  He had found her weeping alone
in her studio.  The strain of Valdana's hideous
suffering and Westenra's long silence sometimes
racked her so that she was glad of the relief of
tears.  "You know what Jean Paul Richter said of
music,--'Thou speakest to me of things which in
all my endless life I have found not--and shall not
find';--that is what you and the sea and the violin
say to me."</p>
<p class="pnext">She blessed him for that, not from gratified
vanity, but for comfort in the thought that others
besides herself suffered from the cry of those
things "that we find not nor shall find."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Dear boy," she said, and stroked his hair as
if he had been Bran while he knelt by her.  "I
love you too--as if you were my son, as your
mother must have loved you, Rupert."</p>
<p class="pnext">Rupert kissed her hand in a very un-sonlike
fashion and looked at her lips.</p>
<p class="pnext">"I want to comfort you," he said, "to take
pain out of your life."</p>
<p class="pnext">"You cannot do that, Rupert."  She quoted
gently--"'Pain is the Lord of Life--none can
escape from its net.'"  Something in his eyes made
her go on steadily.  "My pain is chiefly caused by
love.  I love my little Brannie's father, Rupert--there
can never be any other man in my life.  He
speaks to me of all those things which I have found
not nor shall find!"</p>
<p class="pnext">Rupert bowed his head again over her hand, his
boyish mouth drawn in a straight line.  It was
unfortunate that the Comtesse, whom the <em class="italics">femme
de ménage</em> had admitted to the entrance hall,
should have come softly in at that moment.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Ah, the nice Poulot!" she twittered merrily.
"Taking the lessons of deportment from the
<em class="italics">charmante</em> Madame Val!"  And burst into happy
laughter.</p>
<p class="pnext">But she had not called it "deportment" when
she reported the episode to Haidee a few days later.</p>
<p class="pnext">"He is gone, our Poulot," she said mournfully.
"She has put into bandages his hands and foots--a
slave!"</p>
<p class="pnext">"He did not seem very bandaged last time he
came out here," answered Haidee rather snappishly,
not even amused any more by the Comtesse's
weird English.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Ah, but you do not see him with her, my
child!  It is amazing how she finds the time and
energy for so much 'flirt'!--She is enormous!--and
with the sick lover in the third <em class="italics">atelier</em> all the
same time!"</p>
<p class="pnext">"The sick lover!  Comtesse, what <em class="italics">do</em> you mean?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Ah, of course, I did not tell you yet.  The
concierge it was who informed me that Madame
Valdana occupies herself with a sick gentleman
in the third room.  The doctor every day, and
always fruit and flowers arriving.  Is it not
romantic?  But always silence and the sealed-up lip from
Madame Valdana.  She takes no one into her
heart where the secret is, except Poulot."</p>
<p class="pnext">Haidee was now looking frightfully miserable.
These visits from Madame de Vervanne were a
disturbing element in her life and almost she
wished they could be dispensed with.  She was
working hard to try and pass her <em class="italics">baccalauréat</em>
and achieve her <em class="italics">diplôme</em>, but a visit from the
Comtesse always left her disinclined to grapple with
school work.  And this news about Rupert and
Val irritated her intensely.  What business had Val
to let Rupert get so fond of her?  It was a shame,
a wrong to her--Haidee.  First Westenra, then
Sacha, now Rupert--just when he was so nice to
her, and she was beginning to like him so much.
She ground her teeth in childish rage and jealousy.
The Comtesse put an arm round her waist and they
walked together down the paths of the Lycée
gardens, now dank and sodden by winter rains.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Tell me ... could not the papa of Bran make
her mind her own business, which is surely to
nurse the sick friend and leave poor Rupert alone?
I think he will not even pass his exam, for the
Colonials if he had not a mind at ease.  You know
he is working for that now, so that when he has
done his two years' service he will be eligible if he
still wishes to enter."</p>
<p class="pnext">How his mind would be eased by a break with
Val she did not specify.  Nor why she had
developed such fervour for the hitherto detested
Colonial infantry scheme.  But Haidee was in no
state of mind to thrash out these intricacies.
Worked up by the subtle Frenchwoman's malice
into a state of teeming anger against Val, and blind
to the fact that she was being used as a catspaw,
she allowed herself to consider the Comtesse's
suggestion, and in the end wrote Westenra a
letter which contained many bitter and cruel
things about Val, and gave him fuller information
concerning the three studios than even the story
of the Comtesse justified.  That she was ashamed
of herself for her action, and that it was only a
passing spirit of vindictiveness which impelled it,
did not make the letter as a document any the
less poignantly indicting.</p>
<div class="center transition">
<p class="pfirst">――――</p>
</div>
<p class="pfirst">And that same evening Val was watching the
final effort of Valdana's troubled spirit to break
from the bonds of the body and go forth upon its
way.  Ate Dea had run him to earth.  The Hand
whose fingers he had slipped through on the veldt
was closing in on him inexorably, but with a
worse thing in it now than a soldier's short sharp
doom.  It was only a matter of hours when he
must join those others from whom he had fled--but
with a difference!  The difference between the
lonely, painful death from an atrocious malady,
and an end worthy of a man, face to the enemy,
his comrades about him--</p>
<blockquote>
<div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line">"Fighting hard and dying grimly,</div>
<div class="line">Silent lips and striking hand."</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="pfirst">"It seems hardly worth while now to have
shirked!" he said quietly.  "Just for a few more
years crawling up and down the earth!  I wonder
why we dread old Death so, Val?  After all he 's
the best pal we have--always waiting so patiently
and faithfully; whatever we do, nothing estranges
him from his purpose.  He never gets mad and
takes our gift and gives it to some other
fellow--the gift of rest, darkness, sleep!"</p>
<p class="pnext">Like many a blackguard Valdana cherished in
the deeps of him odds and ends of noble thought
and chivalrous intention garnered from the lines
of some man-poet.  Lindsay Gordon always was
the waster's poet, and always will be.  He helped
Horace Valdana to die now with gratitude instead
of curses in his mouth.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line">"Tho' the gifts of the Light in the end prove curses,</div>
<div class="line">Yet abides the gift of the Darkness,</div>
<div class="inner line-block">
<div class="line">Sleep!"</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="pfirst">His mind had grown strangely clear.  He lay
upon the wide divan in the centre of the room, and
his eye roving from object to object, unusual
recognition in its glance.  A Godin stove glowed
in one corner of the great room; the fire in it had
never been allowed to die out since the first
occupation of the studio.  It filled the room with a
summery warmth that drew out to the last drop
the fragrance of a jar of Sicilian lilac that stood
in the open window; and brought lovely memories
of the veldt from an enormous bunch of mimosa
stuck in a blue pot on the piano.  So warm was the
climate of the room that a balcony door stood
perpetually open, even on a night such as this,
when the outside air sliced against the warmth of
the body with the keenness of a scimitar.  Shaded
lights threw faintly-tinted shadows in far corners.
The only objects that showed clear in the dimness
of the big shadowy room were the busts and figures
of dead white clay--a gigantic head of Tolstoi,
bearded, rugged; a perfect reproduction of Houdon's
bust of Napoleon as First Consul; some little
Donatello angels.</p>
<p class="pnext">"It 'll be cold lying here in a Paris cemetery,
Val!" said Valdana musingly.</p>
<p class="pnext">His eye rested reflectively on the face of <em class="italics">L'Inconnue</em>,
hung on a nail against a pale green-and-rose
Persian rug--that lovely mask taken from the
dead face of a young unknown girl, fished out one
morning from the river's muddy waters.  She had
cast her secret into the bosom of the Seine, and
that kind, wicked, cruel, voluptuous, motherly
old river had kept it for ever, so that to this day
the world still wonders and longs to know who the
girl was, and why with youth and beauty and all
the gifts of life stamped upon her she chose to go
out into the dark with that little radiant smile on
her lips, as if in the last instant she had thought
on some wondrous hour into which all the beauty
of life had been compressed--and was glad to die
because that hour could never come again.</p>
<p class="pnext">Val, who had often studied the quietly smiling
tragic face, said once:</p>
<p class="pnext">"It was some man's eyes she was thinking of
just before she sprang!  That little smile was
meant for just one man in the world."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Yes: it'll be cold lying here in Paris," repeated
Valdana thoughtfully.  "I wish now I 'd stayed
with those fellows at Platkop.  They have the
sunshine, and they 're all together."</p>
<p class="pnext">Val smoothed the bright rug that lay over him
with her thin nervous hands.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Don't bother now, Dan."</p>
<p class="pnext">It was many a long year since she had called
him by that name which pity now wrung from her.</p>
<p class="pnext">"I wonder why I should have been the only
one not wounded?"  He looked at her critically.
"All the others had got it somewhere, but I had n't
a thing, not a spot!  And there was n't a bullet
left among those blasted Boers: it was easy enough
to slink off as the evening came on ... but some
of the fellows looked at me as I undid that door.
No one said anything, but they <em class="italics">looked</em> at me, Val."</p>
<p class="pnext">Val hid her eyes.</p>
<p class="pnext">"One or two of them thought I was going to try
for some water from the spruit near by--God! it
was as hot as hell there all that poisonous
day--and no water!  Yes, some of them thought
... but Brand, my sub, he knew.  I saw the look he
gave as I crept to the door--and the smile--half
his face was shot away, but he could still
smile--he knew I did n't mean to come back----"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Don't talk about it any more," whispered the
woman by his bedside.</p>
<p class="pnext">In a swift vision she saw the shot-away face with
the brave scornful smile on it, and longed to hold
it to her breast and kiss its broken bloody lips.
Oh, if men knew how women consecrate those
brave, quiet acts done in lone places with none to
pity or to praise!</p>
<p class="pnext">"Whose face is that hanging smiling there over
your writing-desk?"  His eyes were on another
death-mask now, the most wonderful the world
has ever seen.  Keen, salient, proud yet gentle,
all the arrogance and lust of power and good living
gone--only peace, the traces of physical pain, and
a gentle irony about the lips, left only ideality and
lofty hope stamped above the brows.  The world
has one thing for which to thank the Corsican
doctor Antommarchi--that he took the cast of
Napoleon's face "when illness had transmuted
passion into patience, and death with its last
serene touch had restored the regularity and
grandeur of youth."  That was the face from which
Horace Valdana could not keep his eyes.</p>
<p class="pnext">"By Jove!" he whispered at the last.  "He
had the same thing as I 've got.  He must have
known the same hell as I am suffering now.
Who am I that I should complain!"</p>
<p class="pnext">The thought helped him to "overcome the sharpness
of death," and die with greater dignity than
he had lived.</p>
<p class="pnext">A few days later, Val, with Rupert Lorrain
standing by her side in the cemetery of
Montparnasse, dropped a few violets, flowers of
compassion and forgiveness, into an open grave, and
Rupert threw down a friendly sod.</p>
<p class="pnext">Already it was spring.  The winter of pain and
misery was past.  On the graves crocuses were
thrusting out their little sheathed heads, symbolic
proof of the sweetness that comes forth from
sorrow.</p>

<div class="vspace" style="height: 2em">
</div>
<p class="pfirst">But for the time being she went no farther than
to the South of France.  Not less than she,
Bran, after wintering among houses, needed open
skies.  They were of one blood, and the longing
for blue was on them both--the blue of space and
sea and sky.  And nowhere better in Europe can
that blueness be found in April and May than
down along the Mediterranean coast.  At first they
went to Ste. Maxime, a little village pitched in
green and golden beauty beside St. Tropez's azure
bay, and from where at dawn the sun can be
seen shooting up from his golden bath just behind
Corsica.  For just several seconds the little
island, cradle of the world's greatest general,
shows like an inky mound against an aureole of
yellow light that swiftly turns to rose, for another
moment the sun rests on the peak of its highest
mountain, then Corsica seems to sink and
disappear into the sea until the next day's dawn.</p>
<p class="pnext">Val did not stay long at Ste. Maxime.  She
wanted a villa where she could have Bran to
herself, after the long months of enforced absences
from him.  If her unexpected fortune could not
give her the delicious joy of absolute companionship
and intimacy with her child it was useless
indeed!  Besides, in hotels children are swiftly
spoilt by people who do not afterwards have to
bear the brunt of the spoiling, and Val did not
mean Garrett Westenra's boy to become weakened
by the petting of Frenchwomen who love to treat
other people's children like pretty lap-dogs--to
be caressed in certain moods and thrust aside
in others.</p>
<p class="pnext">So after a week or two during which an agent
busied himself on her behalf, she moved on to
Cannes, and took possession of an ideal villa he
had found for her.  It lay above the road between
Cannes and Cap d'Antibes, but perched high
beyond the dust and din of motors; on the right, La
Croisette winged away into the sea, on the left,
a gaunt shoulder of the Alps with a shawl of snow
draped on it showed keen against the mistral-swept
skies; while about it, in all the tall beauty and
tropical splendour of Riviera foliage, clustered a
garden full of dreams.  A garden of winding paths
edged by ivy leaves lying flat, and little wild
strawberry plants thrusting up coral fruits; tall
palms and cacti glowing with flaming candelabra,
waxen-leaved creepers, branching giant-aloes,
delicate fern-like mimosa leaning tenderly above beds
of violets, large as purple butterflies, great patches
of poppies, massed clumps of heather white as
snow and bright with happy bees; and everywhere
roses, roses drowsing in the sunshine, perfuming
the air!</p>
<p class="pnext">It was a garden in which coolness could be
found on the sultriest day of summer, but for
spring days the open space before the wide white
steps and pillared porch was ideal.  The floor of
this space was of gravel, bleached by rain and a
southern sun to snowy whiteness.  A clump of tall
pines spiking against the sky afforded a webwork
of flickering shadows under which to sit as in a
balcony hung over the blueness of Golfe Juan.
Always there are ships in that bay of molten
turquoise; red-sailed fishing boats; leaden-coloured
warships, with their grim air of power, lying at
anchor; yachts spreading white wings for flight.</p>
<p class="pnext">The house itself, like nearly all Riviera villas,
was square built, and standing alone would have
been less beautiful than solid and comfortable-looking.
But in its jewelled setting of leaf and
gold and blazing colour, the walls of dead white
gave a note of quiet beauty and peace.  A long
balcony from the upper rooms dripped with
clematis, and all round the house, high on the
walls, large medallions bore the names of the days.
Alternately with these were other medallions on
which were painted on a pale blue ground white
and scarlet-winged storks, flying, flying like the
days.</p>
<p class="pnext">The Villa of Little Days, a poetess who had
lived and dreamed there named it.  She was a
famous woman, a friend of Gambetta, who in his
lifetime came often to visit her.  It was she who
had planned the wild and tender beauty of the
garden.  Val blessed her often in the spring
months she and Bran passed there.</p>
<p class="pnext">The domestic arrangements were, from her
point of view, ideal.  A garage across the road
pertained to the villa, and had attached to it a
cottage which was occupied by a man and his
wife whose services were at the disposal of those
who rented the villa.  The man minded the great
garden all through the sultry summer, dug,
gathered, transplanted, and cut firewood from the
pines for the log fires of winter; also he could
drive a car, and did not disdain to clean a window.
His wife Marietta, a big-boned gay-faced Marseillaise,
with the bloom of a peach on her cheeks,
and rings of garnets in her ears, made short work of
such cleaning as a villa bathed in perpetual
sunshine and purified by sea-breezes needed.  Incidentally,
she could serve up a tureen of <em class="italics">bouillabaisse</em> of
a flavour and fragrance to seduce the heart of a
king and convert a vegetarian from his amazing ways.</p>
<p class="pnext">Bran, happy as always within sight of the sea,
raced the garden with his "fox," or sat under
the pines with his mother, listening to the pine
needles growing, or hearing stories of the Greek
heroes who, on the shores of the Mediterranean,
seem to be more real and comprehensible than in
any other part of the world.  Perhaps because old
Greece and the Ionian Isles are so near at hand!
Indeed, the lure of the horizon is so great on that
fair shore, that if she had been alone in the world
nothing could have held Val from taking train to
Marseilles, and from thence as fast as ship could
bear her.  But Bran and his well-being bound her
fast like Prometheus to his rock.  The rush of
trains and the throb of ships' machinery are no
furtherances to health in young children.  It is in
quiet gardens and comfortable homes that the
young heart expands and the little body shoots
and flourishes.  The garden of the veldt was what
she could most have wished for him--that wild
garden where her own heart had grown its dreams.
But it was far, far, and only to be reached by such
long journeying as the child was not yet fit for.
So she stayed with him in the southern garden,
and if her own heart sailed away sometimes in the
ships that slid over the horizon down the side of
the world, her body remained to guard Westenra's
son and to give him what she "possessed of soul."</p>
<p class="pnext">Her only regret was that Haidee too could not be
revelling in the golden southern sunshine.  But
Haidee was studying at Versailles with quite
extraordinary energy.  The exams. were close
upon her, and Val was far from wishing to divert
her attention from the goal.  She had never failed
to impress upon the child the importance of mental
equipment that is grounded on solid instruction.
She could see for Haidee too, where she had never
seen for herself, that to leave the mind and heart
and soul open and waiting for some man to walk
in and fill them is to court disaster.  There is no
man in the world big enough to fill the heart and
mind and soul of a woman worth considering.
The thing is to fill them first with beauty and
learning and wisdom, and let the man come in
after, if there be room.  For a woman to stake
everything on a man is to play a losing game.
But another love in the soul, be it music, literature,
art, mathematics, or the maternal instinct, is
insurance against total beggary.  If by great good
chance a man's love brings happiness, then the
other love is an added glory; if misery comes the
other is a refuge.</p>
<p class="pnext">Poor Val!  She had not followed the creed
herself, but she saw well enough the wisdom of it
for Haidee, and had tried to instil into her the
prudence of going nap on Art rather than on Heart.
She wanted Haidee to benefit by her own failures,
and never ceased from urging and encouraging her
on towards a goal.  A further instigation she used
freely was the mention of the great pride and
pleasure Westenra would feel in her successful
passing of the "<em class="italics">Bacho</em>" and gaining of the <em class="italics">diplôme</em>.</p>
<p class="pnext">But Haidee, in response to all letters, kept on
saying nothing.  Even to Val's promise of a trip
to the South as soon as the exams, were over, she
made no more than a sullen acknowledgment.
But Val knew from the reports of the professors
that she was working hard.</p>
<p class="pnext">Most people flee from the Riviera during the
summer months.  Of course it is hot, but that is
not the reason.  With the advent of the hot
weather the Riviera becomes very quiet.  The
"season" is over, and the fashionable birds fly
away.  But as a matter of fact the charm of the
place is only ripening.  The blaze and beauty of
the scene become riper and more gorgeous.  The
white villas disappear into their gardens,
submerged by a flood of green leaves that hide and
protect them from the blaze and dust, though of
the last there is less than in the season, for the
motors cease from troubling and the siren is at
rest.  The sweet silence of the night is unbroken
by blood-curdling shrieks or jerked-out hoots from
the cars of those rushing to, or returning furiously
from, Monte Carlo.  Of course in the bungalow
type of villa built to catch the spring sunshine, and
with no well-treed garden in which to shelter from
fierce heat, it would be unwise and uncomfortable
to stay through the summer; but in the Villa of
Little Days there was every comfort within and
without, and nothing to irk except the occasional
bite of a mosquito that had intrigued its way
through wired windows and mosquito netting.
The days passed in a great idle peace.  For Val
was frankly idle--with her hands.  With her
mind she was always working and giving forth to
Bran.  But with her hands, for the first time in her
life since she had sat idle under the shadow of a
buck-sail imbibing her father's vagabond creeds,
she did nothing.  And, even as in those days
Gay Haviland had handed on to his child what
was his of greatness of heart and soul, so in the
southern garden during long torrid days of tropical
peace, when under the tingling ether thought
seemed to detach itself in bright fountains from the
sluggish mass of lesser things, Val gave of all that
was best in her to Westenra's son.  The pity of
it is that all mothers cannot have this unlimited
leisure to give to their children in the days when
character is forming for life.</p>
<p class="pnext">In a sense, too, Val was at peace for the first time
since her early marriage.  The menace and terror
of Valdana's existence, the load she had carried
on her conscience for years with regard to her
position in Westenra's life, all had been swept
away by the hand of Death, the greatest friend!
And she was free of Westenra too.  Whether it
were true or not that he intended to marry Miss
Holland she would never lay claim to his life or
name again, never return to that life in New York
that crippled her soul, robbed her of her individuality,
and turned her into a useless, incapable
creature whom she herself despised.</p>
<p class="pnext">The decision was not even hers to make--at
least so it seemed to her.  He had made it for her
in Jersey.  And it was all old grief and pain!
She had learned during those terrible months of
nursing Horace Valdana to hush her heart to rest.
She had had her chance with Garrett and his love,
and failed, it seemed.  Even in spite of Valdana's
resurrection she would surely, had she been worthy,
have kept Westenra's love?  As it was, love had
done with her, she would never feel passion again.</p>

</blockquote>
<p class="pfirst">The brave thing was to face the fact and abide
by it.  Besides, she had Bran.  A woman who is
a mother can never be quite lonely and unhappy.
One little chapel of the heart may remain empty
and dismantled but all other spaces in it are filled
to overflowing.  And ... away at the back of
Val's mind a dream had begun to simmer and
waver and take form--a dream of a waggon on the
veldt, with Bran.  Some day she would return to
work and wandering--she knew that now.</p>
<div class="center transition">
<p class="pfirst">――――</p>
</div>
<p class="pfirst">In the autumn Haidee passed her exams, brilliantly,
getting honours with her "<em class="italics">Bacho</em>" and a
first-class <em class="italics">diplôme</em>.  It was a great achievement,
and Val was deeply pleased, knowing how the news
would gratify Westenra.  She wrote at once
sending Haidee a beautiful gift in celebration of the
success, and asking when she should come to
Paris and fetch her South.  For by this time she
had discovered that she could trust Marietta with
Bran, and had no fear of leaving him for a few days.</p>
<p class="pnext">But Haidee wrote back coldly, barely acknowledging
the gift, and stating that she wished to
stay on at the Lycée working at her music and
painting until December, when Celine Lorrain and
her father were coming down to Marseilles to see
the last of Rupert, who, having finished his two
years' military service, was going out to Morocco.
Val made no objection to this plan, but her heart
was chilled at this open preference for strangers.
The Lorrains were good friends, of course, but
after all she and Haidee had been through poverty
and sorrow and sickness together.  She looked
upon the girl, if not as her child, at least as her
younger sister.  Was it possible that she still
cherished resentment about Sacha?  At any rate
Val was too proud to make any further advances.
She knew Haidee to be one of those natures that
are not softened by kindly advances, but rather
inclined to hold the advancers in contempt for
their pains--a fault of youth that passes with
a wider knowledge and experience of humanity.</p>
<p class="pnext">When she had gone to say good-bye to Haidee
before leaving Paris, it was with the intention of
telling her the wonderful news about the necklace,
and also as much as was necessary of the return
and death of Valdana without exactly revealing the
identity of the latter and his relationship to
herself.  However, Haidee's bleak manner had nipped
untimely in the bud the good intention.  Val
could not afford to take into her confidence any one
who was not entirely sympathetic, and though she
did not believe that Haidee would be capable of
deliberate disloyalty, yet she realised that the
latter, in spite of the grown-up airs, was only a
child, and as such liable to be swayed by moods in
which she might fling a confidence to the four
winds, and repent her action when it was too late.
And the secret of Horace Valdana's resurrection
had not been kept these many years for it to be
lightly betrayed by a child.  As for the matter of
the fortune gained by the sale of the Comfort
necklace, Val had been obliged to strangle her
longing to tell Haidee all about it, for how could
she suppose that any one who showed such an
almost offensive indifference to her affairs was
really burning with curiosity to know the meaning
of her suddenly changed circumstances?  Haidee
hid her feelings well.  Thus it came to pass that
a secret which Val would gladly have shared and
felt redoubled pleasure in the sharing, had been
kept of necessity to herself.  She had not even
told Rupert, for she felt that apart from the
children no one else before Westenra had a right to
know.  And since Westenra showed no further
interest in her--well, it was no one's affair.</p>
<p class="pnext">When the week came for the expected arrival
of Haidee, what was Val's intense surprise to
receive a letter from her saying that she should
not be coming down with the Lorrains.  For one
thing, she wrote, General Lorrain was ill and
Celine could not leave him, so that Rupert would
be travelling alone.  For another, she added
casually, as if prompted by an afterthought, "Garry
is in Paris and we are going about a great deal
together.  It is possible that he may come down
South--<em class="italics">to see Bran</em> before he returns to New York.
But this is not quite certain.  I will let you know
later."</p>
<p class="pnext">Westenra in Europe for the first time for four
years, and this was the way he notified her!  Val
was stricken to the soul.  Never had she so acutely
realised the position to which he had relegated
her.  A mere minder of his child, and in some
respects not so good as that, for a nurse or governess
would at least have received kindly and courteous
letters from her employer.  This casual second-hand
message seemed to be the cruellest of any
of the blows her heart had suffered since first she
threw in her lot with Garrett Westenra.  And at
first she sank under it.  It was the little more that
is too much.  But presently with some of her old
courage she braced herself to the new situation.
If she had got to meet Westenra she would be ready
for it.  She had not trained her soul for years to no
avail.  She had not lived with austerity, stood
apart from temptation, fought spiritual battles,
for nothing.  A strong rock was at her back for
the hour of need, a rock she had been forming for
herself in all the years since she last saw Westenra.
She would be ready when he came to receive him
with dignity and strength untainted by resentment
or any petty feeling.</p>
<p class="pnext">But before that time Rupert the blue-eyed and
ardent, in whom she recognised so much of her own
nature, came bursting into the Calendar of Little
Days.  She welcomed him with all the pleasure
a woman feels in seeing those whose affection for
her is sure and unquestioning, who doubt not her
loyalty and pure intention.</p>
<p class="pnext">His light-heartedness seemed to have waned a
little, and his pleasure at having attained his
majority and freedom to depart where he listed was
not so great as Val had expected.  He explained
the reason succinctly.</p>
<p class="pnext">"It is all very well to be rich and free, Val, but
I am very alone in the world."  His eyes resting
in hers took an expression of intense melancholy.</p>
<p class="pnext">"That is the curse the gods lay upon us wanderers,
Rupert," she said sadly.</p>
<blockquote>

<p class="pfirst">"Yet it is that loneliness we are always trying
by our own efforts to alleviate."</p>
<p class="pnext">"There is only one person in the world who can
alleviate it for me."</p>
<p class="pnext">"And you have not found her yet," interrupted
Val promptly, and before he could say what she
read in his eyes, continued swiftly: "I want you
to tell me all about Haidee.  You saw her recently,
didn't you?  How is she looking?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Very pretty," said Rupert gloomily.  "She
is a great beauty, that Haidee, and looks no longer
like a brown pony."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Brown pony?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Ah, I should not have said that!  It was one of
poor Sacha's <em class="italics">blagues</em> that she always looked like a
wild pony with her brown mane flying ... but
she is very different now and quite cured of Sacha,
with her hair put up and long frocks and the
self-possessed manner of twenty."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Has she really got her hair up?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Yes, indeed.  I saw her with the guardian.
He is a fine fellow, is n't he?  She is much in love
with him.  I think they will marry."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Marry!"  Val started as if a missile had struck
her.  A moment later she controlled herself and
laughed--an odd, nervous laugh.  "Why, Rupert,
how silly you are!  She is practically Dr. Westenra's
child.  He has brought her up from a baby."</p>
<p class="pnext">"That makes nothing.  She is not a baby any
more, and she does n't look at him like a father.  I
prophesy to you that Haidee marries him."</p>
<p class="pnext">He was arrested by Val's expression.</p>
<p class="pnext">"You do not care for such a marriage?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"It is out of the question to discuss such a thing,"
she said firmly, but her face was ashen.</p>
<p class="pnext">Rupert examined her acutely.  He did not know
of course that he was speaking of Bran's father.</p>

<p class="pfirst">The Lemprière hat Haidee had on, though it
was only a travelling hat of soft silk, turned
up in front with one orchid, must have cost at least
six guineas, but Westenra had paid it without
blenching.  It seemed to him that Val had trained
him to buying hats and choosing pretty gowns,
though the strange thing, if he had analysed it,
was that he had never bought Val a hat or gown in
his life.  Yet because of Val he knew that women
needed these things, and because life had gone
exceedingly well with him in the last few years, he
bought for Haidee all she asked, and made no
demur.  In America he always travelled second,
but now he and Haidee were in a first-class
carriage, en route for the South of France, and it
seemed natural enough.</p>
<p class="pnext">Haidee had certainly come into her own, and it
was a goodly inheritance of beauty.  With her
hair <em class="italics">coiffé</em> and the hat with the orchid (a wonderful
imitation of a rare species found in the Congo
forest), she was a lovely dryad come to town.
The cut of her tan shantung suit betrayed a
master hand, and from its open coat rippled little
cascades of fine lace.  Yet she looked discontented.
Perhaps the bitter moodiness on the face opposite
had infected her.</p>
<p class="pnext">Westenra had not worn that look when they
commenced the journey; it was within the last
half-hour while they talked of Val that Haidee had
watched it creeping like a shadow into his eyes,
making harsh lines about his mouth.</p>
<p class="pnext">"You should have gone to the Lamartine studios
and made inquiries," she said suddenly.  "Then
you 'd have known all about it--far more than I
wrote and told you!"</p>
<p class="pnext">"I have no right to make inquiries about Val,
Haidee.  She is not my wife and I have no claim
whatever over----"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Not your wife?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"No.  Has she never told you?  Her husband
whom she thought dead came back.  You must
never speak of this to any one."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Of course not.  But how funny, Garry!"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Very funny," he said grimly.  "That is, of
course, who was staying with her at the studios,
with a perfect right to do so.  Only"--his face
took a harder expression--"she can't go on having
Bran too."</p>
<p class="pnext">"But why not, Garry?  She hasn't got the
man--her husband--staying at Cannes with her.
She 's told me heaps of times she and Bran are
there alone.  Rupert wrote and told me too."</p>
<p class="pnext">"That is understood," said Westenra coldly.
"Or I should n't let you go to her, even for a few
days."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Where are <em class="italics">you</em> going?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"To a hotel, of course.  I 've arranged for a
room at the Metropole."</p>
<p class="pnext">Haidee mused awhile, her brows knitted.</p>
<p class="pnext">"And afterwards, Garry--when you have got Bran?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"God knows, Haidee."  He did not speak like a
man who has won fame and renown and almost all
he set out to get--except one small thing!  But
rather as one whose golden gifts have turned to
ashes in the mouth, whose laurels have fallen to
dust.  Inspiration shot into Haidee's eyes.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Then you haven't got a wife at all, Garry?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Devil a wife!"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Then I don't see why I can't marry you at
last.  I 've always wanted to."</p>
<p class="pnext">Westenra began to laugh.</p>
<p class="pnext">"There's nothing to laugh at.  Lots of girls
marry their guardians.  Oh, <em class="italics">do</em> let me marry you,
Garry.  I do love you so."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Dear Silly Billy, I couldn't possibly."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Why not?  Why <em class="italics">not</em>?  How can I come back
to America with you and Bran unless I <em class="italics">am</em> married
to you?  It would not be at all correct."  (Haidee
had not been brought up in conventional France
for nothing!)  Westenra grinned sardonically.</p>
<p class="pnext">"And if you get Bran away from Val, he will
need a mother, and you surely would n't marry
some old strange pig of a woman to mind him.
He 's a gentle little kid and he <em class="italics">must</em> be mothered.
I believe he 'd just die if he did n't have love and
kindness round him all the time."</p>
<p class="pnext">Westenra left off laughing and for the first time
considered her seriously.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Do you think you 'd make him a good step-mother, Haidee?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"I <em class="italics">love</em> Bran, though I 've often been a pig to
him--but <em class="italics">that's</em> Val's fault," she ended
vindictively.  "Oh, do have me, Garry."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Well, we 'll think about it," said he gravely,
though the suspicion of a smile hovered in his eyes.
Haidee pounced upon him with her fresh lips.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Won't I just run your nursing home for you!"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Oh, <em class="italics">that</em>!" said Westenra, startled.  "It runs
itself now.  Besides"--("No more experiments
like that," he had been going to say, but did
not)--"I have practically given it up.  There'll be
nothing for you to do in New York but mind
Bran and amuse yourself."</p>
<p class="pnext">Haidee looked glum for a moment.  It was
plain she was dying to run something.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Anyway it's settled, is n't it, that I am to
marry you and go back with you and Bran?"  She
flung her arms imploringly round his neck.
Gently and a little wearily he unlaced them.</p>
<p class="pnext">"All right, dearest, if you 're so keen on it, you
shall go--but we won't get married just yet, I
think--"  He patted her hand affectionately.</p>
<p class="pnext">"You 'll meet some one you like better than me
on the voyage, perhaps."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Never, never," she said almost viciously,
and her eyes seemed to look down a long passage
which had some one at the end of it.</p>
<p class="pnext">"At last I 've got some one away from her!"
she murmured to herself.</p>
<p class="pnext">Westenra, even though in the past few weeks
he had grown used to her extraordinary childish
innocence and ignorance of life, mixed with a
leaning for outlawry, an amazing respect for
<em class="italics">étiquette</em>, and an anxiety to keep up a conventional
appearance, found this new phase incomprehensible.
He could not understand the gloating triumph
of her manner.  She behaved as if he were
a hunting trophy which she had long yearned
to bag.  A dozen times she would jump up from
her seat, examine him proudly, hug him, and sit
down again murmuring:</p>
<p class="pnext">"I've got you--I've got you, haven't I,
Garry?  No one can get you away again, can they?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Of course not, Silly Billy," came to be his
standard reply.</p>
<div class="center transition">
<p class="pfirst">――――</p>
</div>
<p class="pfirst">Times are when a traveller arriving at Cannes
railway station needs the physique and temper
of a thoroughly-aroused buffalo to make any
impression on the crowd that surges and sways and
laughs and greets and grumbles there.  But on
the early June morning when Westenra and
Haidee Halston descended from the P.M.L. Express
there was no one in sight expect a few
somnolent porters and a tall woman holding a
small arrow-straight boy by the hand.  The
woman was beautifully dressed in white linen and
a hat smothered with red and yellow poppies.
The arrowy boy had a waving topknot of shiny,
ruddy-gold hair, with bare legs and sandalled feet
to make a sculptor rave.</p>
<p class="pnext">Haidee having seen them last recognised them
first.  But even she had to give a second glance
to make sure that it really was Val and Bran.
They both looked so well and charming and
beautiful to behold.  Bran had never had clothes so
truly <em class="italics">magnifique</em> before.  And Val had roses in
her cheeks and lips--a strange thing in so hot a
climate!  Somehow the triumph Haidee had been
exulting over and vengefully trumpeting in her
heart died down and faded away when she saw Val
coming towards her, hands out in the usual eager
fashion, a kiss forming on her lips.  Both she and
Bran at the back of their welcoming smiles seemed
to be wearing their wistful lion-cub expression,
and Haidee had to grip hard on to her vengeance
not to lose it altogether and just fall upon them
both and hug them.  Westenra, too, was aware
of a sensation that surprised him, at the sight of
this woman who had once been so much to his
life and now was nothing, standing there with
frank outstretched hands smiling a welcome from
under her cool flowery hat.  The fact was that
she did not sufficiently look the part of a
shrine-smasher.  If he had not happened to know her
guilty it might have been quite difficult for him to
believe that this was the woman who had
destroyed his life-dreams--and ruined his home.  As
it was he could only marvel at the strangeness of
women who could do such things and yet retain a
look of honesty and inward peace.  He marvelled,
too, that as he took her hand and looked into the
eyes he knew so well his heart stirred like a live
thing.  He was more amazed by that strange
stirring in his breast than if a body he had certified
dead and seen put away into the place of dead
things suddenly quickened in its shroud and
returned to life.  For he had in the last few years
deliberately fought down and crushed out his
feeling for Val as a man might crush and kill a
useless, hopeless thing.  It <em class="italics">was</em> useless that
madness he had felt for her--as useless as she was and
always would be to a sane, practical man.  There
was no use or sense in letting the pain of his
longing for her get the upper hand of him and he
had not let it, but wrestled with it until he got it
under.  Had she not shown him in Jersey that
she did not care enough for him to change?
Shown him, and told him, and proved her
words with deeds.  And it was all old grief and
pain now.  Even if he had still retained any feeling
for her she had gone back to Valdana.  That
ended it all as definitely as if she lay before
him in her coffin.  He would never have
risked seeing her again if it had not been for his son.</p>
<p class="pnext">Ah! his son!  That was different.  It was
natural and justifiable that his veins should thrill
at the sight of such a brave stripling.  Bran,
for all his elfin faun-like grace of body, had a big
face, with the promise of big things lurking behind
its plastic contours and deep-set eyes.  He sprang
into his father's arms and kissed him ardently.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Oh!  Daddy, I do love you."</p>
<p class="pnext">Val's face curiously gave the impression that
it had grown pale, while the colour in her cheeks
and lips "stayed put"--almost as if it <em class="italics">had</em> been
"put."  Haidee was interested in this phenomenon,
but there was no time to give it more than passing
observation, for Rupert Lorrain suddenly flashed
into the scene with the announcement that he would
drive them back in his motor.  They engaged in
a bustle for luggage, of which Haidee had
apparently brought a mountain--and a few moments later
all were packed into Rupert's luxurious Panhard
and flying along the <em class="italics">route Nationale</em>, Bran tooting
the siren and singing at the top of his voice.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Sing before breakfast, you 'll cry before tea,"
quoted Haidee at him.  She had to shriek to be
heard.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Shall we drop you at your hotel, Garrett?
Or will you come to breakfast with us at the Villa?"  Val's
voice was the casual gentle voice of a good
friend.</p>
<p class="pnext">The realisation that he had been calmly and
unquestioningly going back with this noisy crowd
as though it belonged to him, to her villa which
was not his, shocked him into a stiff answer.</p>
<p class="pnext">"At the hotel, please.  And I 'd like Bran to
stay with me this morning, if you don't mind."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Oh, yes," cried Bran, ecstatically.  "I'll come."</p>
<p class="pnext">"I'll bring him back safely to you after lunch."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Of course," said Val, smiling radiantly.  It is
on record that martyrs could radiantly smile even
when the slow fire was applied.</p>
<p class="pnext">So he and Bran were dropped at the Metropole,
not without many proprietary grumblings from
Haidee and warnings from Rupert that he would be
back to join them ere long.  The car drove off
amidst a shower of shouts and calls and farewells.
Only Val sat silent under her poppies.</p>
<p class="pnext">As soon as they were on their way once more,
under cover of the motor's burr, Haidee said,
staring Val defiantly in the eyes:</p>
<p class="pnext">"Garry and I are engaged."</p>
<p class="pnext">It never occurred to her that Rupert had in any
way prepared the way for her announcement, and
she was blinded with amazement and fury that
Val took it so serenely.  True she once more got
the impression of pallor under that unwonted
colour in Val's cheeks, but the latter's eyes were
very big and bright and friendly when she said
quietly:</p>
<p class="pnext">"That is very wonderful news, chicken."</p>
<p class="pnext">That was all!  The lovely dark face under the
Congo orchid grew darker.</p>
<p class="pnext">"We shall be awfully happy," she said fiercely.
"And never think of this rotten old Europe or any
one in it again."</p>
<p class="pnext">Val spoke a strange saying, laying her hand on
the girl's.</p>
<p class="pnext">"One should try alway to keep a little dew in
one's heart, Haidee, or else, in the heat and weariness
of the desert it may dry up and blow away like
a leaf."</p>
<p class="pnext">Haidee wrenched her hand away.</p>
<div class="center transition">
<p class="pfirst">――――</p>
</div>
<p class="pfirst">"And what do you think of being when you 're
a man, Bran?"</p>
<p class="pnext">Bran reflected a while, balancing a spoonful of
strawberry ice-cream on the edge of his glass.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Well, Daddy, sometimes I 'd like to be one of
those professors that feed the animals at the Zoo,
<em class="italics">you</em> know.  But after all, I think I prefer to be an
engine driver."  The little golden face looked up
into Westenra's with the perfect confidence and
frankness of a nature that has never been snubbed
or thwarted.  "You see one could be always
going to new places."</p>
<p class="pnext">Westenra's heart sank.  He got a sudden
vision of Val smiling that very smile of boyish
confidence as she looked up from a deck chair
saying:</p>
<p class="pnext">"I would love to wake up in a new place every
morning of my life."</p>
<p class="pnext">Good God! was it possible that it was after all
only a child, no better or worse than this
golden-headed stripling, whom he had had in his hands
all these years, treating harshly, misjudging,
scolding, neglecting?  The thought was horrible,
but it pierced as though it were true.</p>
<p class="pnext">"What is the good of that, my boy?" he said
gently.  He shrank from losing that lovely
confidence by an unsympathetic word, but--"What
would you do in all those new places?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Do?" Bran mused a while.  "Oh, there'd
always be something to do, Daddy.  Sometimes
the people there would want a bridge made, or a
tower built, or there might be a giant there eating
all the little boys and girls.  Then I would stay
just long enough to kill the giant, you know, or
make the bridge----"</p>
<p class="pnext">"I see."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Or sometimes I would just make a picture of
the place."</p>
<p class="pnext">"A picture?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Yes, I love to make pictures--then get on my
engine again and away I 'd go."</p>
<p class="pnext">So!  This was what she had made his son into?
A vagabond like herself, a wanderer, a seeker after
nothingness?  He said it bitterly to himself, yet
there was no echoing bitterness in his heart.  The
boy's eyes were so sweet and clear.  There seemed
no base thought in any corner of him.  And that
big head and wide glance--surely something great
would come of them!  The boy looked at the
world as if it had been made for him.  Surely
Raleigh had that spirit, and Drake, and Napoleon,
and Cecil Rhodes.  Surely it was the spirit of great
adventure!</p>
<p class="pnext">He spent a strangely happy day with his son.
Unreal, yet as natural as if he himself had lived
every moment of it before.  When at last they
came to the Villa of Little Days it was to find the
others gathered together in the garden, sitting
under the spiking pines.  Capacious easy-chairs
with bright cushions stood about on the gravelled
terrace and everywhere was colour, colour.  Blue
above, and blue below, and round them on shrub
and tree and plant every known and lovely shade
that Nature could invent, all woven and blended
as skilfully as the broidering on some masterpiece
of tapestry.  Val too had returned in jewels and
dress to her love of oriental colouring.  She had two
large silver rings set with turquoises in her ears,
and round her neck a chain of rugged chunks of
malachite and turquoise-matrix.  None of these
things were expensive.  She never bought jewels
because they were valuable, but for the sheer
colour of them and the joy that colour gave.
Diamonds said nothing to her and she would never
have worn them if she had been a millionairess.
The ear-rings were a spare pair of Marietta's
which she had been delighted to sell Val for a
couple of <em class="italics">louis</em>; matrix and malachite are, as every
one knows, almost as common as sea-shells--and
so are violets common, and poppies of the field, and
forget-me-nots; but none the less are they the
colour-gifts of God and the world would be a less
beautiful place without them.  Her gown of some
kind of flexible opaline silk blended with the
colours of the garden, even with the poppy hat
which she still wore.  Westenra had never seen
her look so much at peace with herself and her
surroundings or realised before that she possessed
beauty.  He did not realise indeed that never had
he seen Val in beautiful clothes nor in surroundings
that were full of grace and peace.  Always he had
the picture of her rushing about the house in 68th
Street like some driven wild thing, the worried
look of a hunted creature in her eyes, the grey
linen overalls typical of the grey hurrying life,
making her eyes grey only, without a glint of the
blueness which now made them so attractive.</p>
<p class="pnext">They sat and talked, spying with field-glasses
at the warships in the bay.  Naval manoeuvres
had been going on for some days, and a large
portion of the French fleet lay out in the blue,
throwing great purple shadows upon the water and
sending up streamers of black smoke to heaven.</p>
<p class="pnext">Rupert, as much at home in the family circle as
if he belonged to it, seemed to wish to
monopolise Haidee, but she kept withdrawing from his
advances and plying herself to the task of playing
proprietress to Westenra.  She sat on the arm of
his chair with her arm along his shoulders,
deferring to him in everything, constantly referring
to New York and their premeditated return there.
Westenra, with Bran perched on the back of his
chair, legs dangling round his father's neck, hands
occupied with his father's hair, was forced into
announcing plans of some kind.  He disclosed a
contemplated return to Paris to deliver two
important lectures at the Sorbonne.  That done,
he should return South, and book by some tramp
steamer which would take him home via Greece
and Algeria, sailing from Marseilles.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Don't forget that I'm coming too," said
Haidee feverishly.</p>
<p class="pnext">"How could I?"  Westenra's smile was dry.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Me too, Daddy," chirruped Bran.  A kind of
breathless stillness fell for an instant.  Every one
save Bran, busy with his father's hair, looked
swiftly at Val and as swiftly away again.  Val sat
like a stone woman.  In the silence Bran, who
had gone on twisting his father's hair into little
spikes, spoke again placidly:</p>
<p class="pnext">"Me too, Daddy.  I don't want to be away from
you any more."</p>
<p class="pnext">A pang of joy and triumph shot through
Westenra, but it was mingled with something that cut
like a knife on an open wound.  Val was staring
before her sightlessly.  Yet a little smile played
round her lips--a smile of some feeling Westenra
hardly understood.  There was something infinite
in it, yet terribly human.</p>
<p class="pnext">"You would rather go back to America than stay
with me, Brannie?"</p>
<p class="pnext">It was not pleading, nor sad, nor coaxing.
Just a little simple question.  Only she and
Westenra knew how much hung on it, though one
of the others had a very good notion of what was
behind.  Bran looked across at his mother
hesitatingly.  She had always trained him to truth and
directness, yet he searched her face for a moment
as if for a clue.  Bran hated to hurt any one's
feelings--most of all his mother's.  But she smiled
on, and he could read nothing.  He had never
seen her eyes so empty before, and could not know
by what great effort she had emptied them of all
the fierce love and terror in her heart, so as to
play fair, and not bias the issue.  So after a little
moment Bran said:</p>
<p class="pnext">"I like daddy.  He's got a hard smell--like
steel.  I don't want to be away from him any
more."  He slid an arm round his father's neck.
No one looked at Val.  Suddenly and amazingly
Haidee cried out in a fury of indignation:</p>
<p class="pnext">"You are a little pig, Bran! ... an ungrateful
little pig!"</p>
<p class="pnext">She burst out crying, and jumping up ran to
the house.  Bran's eyes slowly filled with tears.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Haidee <em class="italics">is</em> nasty!" he said in a trembling voice.
"What have I done?"  In his trouble he turned
naturally to his mother and the tenderness that
had never failed him.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Nothing, my Wing.  Haidee will be all right
by and by.  Here is Marietta with the tea."</p>
<p class="pnext">But Westenra would not take tea.  He appeared
to stiffen at the sight of it.  After Bran had
swallowed a hurried <em class="italics">goûter</em>, as the French call it,
his father took him by the hand and they went
away together for a walk by the sea.  When they
came back at seven, Westenra excused himself,
and returned to the hotel with a promise to call
after dinner.</p>
<div class="center transition">
<p class="pfirst">――――</p>
</div>
<p class="pfirst">That evening he and Val walked together
through the twilight garden in which Gambetta
had pondered his plans and philosophies.  They,
too, had a problem to consider.  It had to come,
this talk together.  They both had felt the
imperativeness of it.  And now both were remembering
that other walk on the moonlit cliffs above
St. Brelade's Bay, when the curlew wailed and
cruel words were said that separated them as only
cruel words can separate, driving them apart for
ever.  Even as Val had struggled that long-ago
night for words to explain and condone the
situation Westenra struggled now, while Val walked
beside him still and white, but with some hidden
strength in her which he felt while he could not
understand it.</p>
<p class="pnext">The curious thing was that, though he had
meant to upbraid her, though his heart was bitter
against her, he found himself speaking as if he, not
she, were the defalcator.</p>
<p class="pnext">"I suppose you think me a cold-blooded brute?"</p>
<p class="pnext">With that which Haidee had told her still
tingling in her mind she could not pretend to
misunderstand, but she tried to be fair.</p>
<p class="pnext">"You know your own interests best, Garrett."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Oh, as to my interests--"  He found that a
strange answer, and cogitated on it for a while.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Haidee is devoted to you and your interests."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Haidee?  I should not be such a fool as to
expect that--again?"  No doubt he meant that
javelin to reach her.  If it did she gave no sign.
Only her next words might have been a faint
attempt at a return thrust.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Even Haidee would not find it a very difficult
life since things are so prosperous with you now."</p>
<p class="pnext">He answered swiftly: "Yes; the law of compensation
has been busy with my affairs.  Unlucky in
love--"  The sentence remained unfinished.</p>
<p class="pnext">They found that they were standing still, staring
white-faced at each other.  For a moment they
stayed so, then she said gently:</p>
<p class="pnext">"Surely we have not come here to gibe at one
another?  I--I bear you no ill-will, Garrett."  It
was such a strange way of expressing her feelings
that she could not help but stammer a little.</p>
<p class="pnext">He laughed.  Strange, that he who felt so old
in the train that morning should now feel young
enough for fierce anger and rage.</p>
<p class="pnext">"That is good of you.  I am sorry I cannot with
truth claim to reciprocate your generosity."</p>
<p class="pnext">The calmness that had amazed him sustained her now.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Well, let us leave the subject then, and speak
of one that matters more to our future life--Bran.
What about Bran?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"You saw yourself to-day--you heard."  He
did not care to keep exultation from his voice.</p>
<p class="pnext">"You think it fair, then, to take away from
me what I have lived and worked for these last six
years?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Have not I worked for him too?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"You may have done so.  It has made no difference
to him."</p>
<p class="pnext">"What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"I mean that since we parted in Jersey, Bran,
like myself, has neither eaten nor drunk nor been
clothed at your expense."</p>
<p class="pnext">"But...?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"The exact half of all moneys you have sent is
lying at the Credit Lyonnais.  The other half has
been spent explicitly on Haidee.  You have seen
the bills."</p>
<p class="pnext">His face darkened.</p>
<p class="pnext">"How dared you treat me so?--my own son!"</p>
<p class="pnext">"If you had come to see him it would have been
different, but to stay away year after year, and
expect money to fill the gap that a father's
influence and love and tenderness should have filled
... that seemed to me too mercenary, too
unworthy treatment of <em class="italics">my</em> son."</p>
<p class="pnext">"No matter ... no matter ... it is an
infamous thing you have done--a crowning act of
cruelty.  I should have believed you incapable of
it.  By God! how dared you let any one else feed
and clothe my child?"</p>
<p class="pnext">She looked at his furious face in genuine amazement.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Had I no right to work for him?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"<em class="italics">You</em>, yes; and I know you have--Haidee has
told me.  But this last year ... and <em class="italics">now</em>.  Who is
paying for all this?"  He swung his arm savagely
at the beauties of the garden.  His gaze was full of
rage and contempt.</p>
<p class="pnext">"In leaving Bran I left my honour with you--and
you have sold it for this mess of pottage!  It
is time he went with me!"</p>
<p class="pnext">She faced him steadily, with the calmness born
of long vigils with misery.</p>
<p class="pnext">"You are insulting me unnecessarily.  No one
has supported your son but myself."</p>
<p class="pnext">He stared at her in unbelieving wrath.  But
something about her words and still gaze presently
quieted the fury in his veins, and he spoke
more temperately.</p>
<p class="pnext">"I will be glad to accept that.  It is strange
that by your own efforts you should have become
wealthy enough to surround him with beauty and
ease such as this--but if you say so I accept it."</p>
<p class="pnext">There was a silence.</p>
<p class="pnext">"My own efforts had nothing to do with it,
Garrett.  It is only that God has been good to me.
Did you ever hear the saying, that 'God takes
care of drunkards and children'?"</p>
<p class="pnext">He regarded her long and earnestly.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Are you a drunkard?"  Anything less like
one he had never seen.  His medical experience
told him that she could not be one.  No drunkard
could look as she did.</p>
<p class="pnext">"No, Garrett.  I can faithfully and truthfully
say that I am not a drunkard."</p>
<p class="pnext">Then she was a child.  It was a child that he----!</p>
<p class="pnext">"Let me tell you about it," she was saying.
"About eleven months ago something that might
be regarded in the light of a family legacy came to
me.  The necklace my mother gave me turned out
to be of extremely valuable pearls.  I sold it for
seventy-five thousand pounds--it has since realised
one hundred and twenty thousand.  That is the
secret of such comfort and ease as you now see us
enjoying."</p>
<p class="pnext">The story was amazing, but Westenra instinctively
knew it to be true.  He had often been
struck by the wonderful pearly beauty of the
Comfort necklace.</p>
<p class="pnext">"I am glad for your sake," he said at last; "it
must simplify the future a great deal.  I beg your
pardon for what I said a moment ago.  It is bad
enough that I should have been denied the right
to support my own son--but I could not bear
that that other fellow should have done it.  It
even sticks in my gorge that you should have
allowed Bran to come into contact with him."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Whom are you speaking of, Garrett?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Why do you ask that?  Surely you do not
think me unaware of the fact of your return to
Valdana?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Ah!" she said softly, and drew in her breath.
"You know that?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Of course I know.  It was that knowledge
which brought me to France.  I could not allow
Bran or even Haidee, to be anywhere within the
radius of that--"  He bit off "scoundrel."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Neither of them has ever seen him----"</p>
<p class="pnext">"I thank you for that at least."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Nor would ever have seen him."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Oh, as to----"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Is that the reason you would not enter my
house nor accept my hospitality?"</p>
<p class="pnext">He did not answer, but his neck stiffened, and
he gave her the direct look which she well knew
meant assent.  And she thought to herself:</p>
<p class="pnext">"There is not anything base and odious of
which he does not think me capable.  It is well
that he and I should part for ever.  The soul
constantly suspected of baseness and cruelty must
become degraded in time and shrink away to
nothing.  I will go away from here to places
where my soul can grow and not shrink."  These
thoughts passed swiftly through her mind.  All
she said aloud was:</p>
<p class="pnext">"You need not have feared.  Horace Valdana
has never come here, nor ever will.  He and I will
not meet again."</p>
<p class="pnext">They had come out of the shadowy whispering
paths and reached the open gravelled terrace, with
the still waters of the Mediterranean lying below,
silent under the stars, sombre as a pool of blue ink.
The little group of chairs stood inviting.  By
mutual consent they sat down.  Inside the Villa
Haidee was at the piano playing wide, gallant
chords, to which Rupert, in a rather strong tenor,
sang snatches of the <em class="italics">Paimpolaise</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line">"Et le pauvre gars ... fredonne tout has:</div>
<div class="inner line-block">
<div class="line">*    *    *    *    *</div>
</div>
<div class="line">'J'aime Paimpol et sa falaise,</div>
<div class="inner line-block">
<div class="line">Son cloche et son grand Pardon.</div>
</div>
<div class="line">J'aime encore mieux, la Paimpolaise</div>
<div class="inner line-block">
<div class="line">Qui m'attend au pays breton.'"</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="pfirst">"Of course," said Westenra slowly, "if you are
alone, and are going to be alone ... I have no
right to take Bran."</p>
<p class="pnext">"There is no question of right--"  She put her
hand over her heart--she could not speak calmly
of this last savage blow fate was dealing her by
the hand of her loved son.  "He wants to go.
That is enough."</p>
<p class="pnext">"You know I will mind him well," he said gently.</p>
<p class="pnext">"No one can mind him as I do," was her inward
cry, but she said nothing, only pressed her hand
harder to her side.</p>
<p class="pnext">"----and that he will come back to you.  It is
only fair that I should have him for a little while,
but naturally I do not want to keep him from you,
and I am very sure he would not stay."</p>
<p class="pnext">She was still silent.  He looked at her keenly.
Each knew what the other suffered, for at the
heart of each the parent hunger gnawed with cruel
teeth.</p>
<p class="pnext">"You will not beguile him from his wish to come
with me?--I am very sure you could.  It would be
natural for him to stick to you after all you 've
done for him--but you won't?"  Almost he was
pleading with her.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Did I to-day?"  Her face was bleak.</p>
<p class="pnext">"No, God knows--and it would have been easy enough!"</p>
<p class="pnext">"I know he needs you.  A boy begins to need a
father's influence, and Bran has always had a
hunger for men and their ways ... but, oh! mind
him well, Garrett Westenra ... mind him well
... give him back to me as sweet and whole in
soul and body as I lend him to you--"  Her voice
broke.  She could bear no more.  Swiftly she rose,
and with a little gesture full of despair and
abnegation and farewell, left him.</p>
<div class="center transition">
<p class="pfirst">――――</p>
</div>
<p class="pfirst">The next day Westenra was gone, presumably
to Paris to give his lectures.  Rupert, who had
walked home with him the night before, brought a
brief message of farewell to the Villa of Little
Days, and the news that they might expect him
back in anything under ten days.</p>
<p class="pnext">As for Val, she went to bed for a week.  At
least she retired to her room, declaring a fear that
a slight cold she had might develop into <em class="italics">grippe</em>, and
that summer <em class="italics">grippe</em> was the most boring of all
illnesses, and that she was not going to risk
becoming the greatest of bores.  So she lay down a good
deal in a darkened room.  When she was not
resting she wrote many letters, and in the cool of the
evening she would sit on her clematis-wreathed
balcony with Bran in her arms, her lips on his hair,
listening to his account of the day's doings.  For
Rupert's car was perpetually at the gate, and never
a day passed but he and Haidee and Bran set off
on some long excursion into the surrounding
country.</p>
<p class="pnext">Haidee came up to Val's room sometimes to
make perfunctory inquiries.  She would stare
hard at the latter lying so lazily amongst her
cushions, and narrowly search the smiling face.
But, except that colour had fled from cheek and lip,
Val showed no signs of trouble, only a vivid
interest in all they had been doing.</p>
<p class="pnext">"You do take it easy, I must say," Haidee
remarked half grudgingly the fourth evening after
Westenra's departure.  "Lying here in the cool
while we have to scoot about in the heat and
dust."</p>
<p class="pnext">Val laughed.</p>
<p class="pnext">"You don't <em class="italics">have</em> to, chicken.  And scooting
in a motor is not so very disagreeable after all.
You look as if it agreed with you, anyway."</p>
<p class="pnext">Indeed the girl was radiant, and her half-hearted
grumblings were entirely contradicted by her
eager air of enjoying life.  She need not have
resented that Val smiled so brightly from her bed,
and perhaps she would not have done so if she
could have seen that when the door closed on her
the light went out of the smoke-coloured eyes, and
the smile withered, leaving only weariness upon
Val's lips.</p>
<p class="pnext">But on the day Westenra's return was notified
by telegram Val came down very bright and gay
and presided over the tea-table under the pines.
Rupert had just brought the others back from
Grasse in a condition of physical flop, and all three
were distributed upon chairs in attitudes of utter
abandon.  Val, with all the colour back again in
her pale dark face, looked fresher than any of
them.  Westenra's wire was a subject of great
intrigue.  It had come not from Paris, but from a
little out-of-the-way place called Baurem les
Mimosas, which lay about two hours from Cannes
and not even on the main line!  No one knew by
which train he was coming, or where to go and
meet him.</p>
<p class="pnext">"I don't believe he has been in Paris at all,"
said Haidee discontentedly, and certainly the man
who at that moment appeared at the top of one
of the winding paths and came strolling towards
them bore no stamp of Paris on himself or his
raiment.  His face, in spite of the protecting
brim of a cow-puncher's hat which had clearly seen
life and experience in other climes, was badly
sunburnt, and he wore a truly disreputable grey
flannel suit of the reach-me-down class, and
evidently made for the French figure rather than
for an Irishman of large and athletic build.  The
waist and hip measurements were of such
amplitude as to give a slightly <em class="italics">bouffant</em> effect, but
the calf accommodation was limited to bursting
point; the rest of the trouser-leg would have
hung in frills round the ankles had they not been
secured tightly by large white safety-pins.  A
pair of "Weary Willie" canvas shoes completed
Westenra's outfit.</p>
<p class="pnext">"<em class="italics">Garry!</em>" gasped Haidee, shocked beyond words.
But Bran leaped upon his father and embraced
him joyously.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Where you been, Daddy?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"I been bicycling," responded daddy affably
and saluted every one, beginning with Val and
ending with Rupert.  "That's where I been!"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Bicycling!  What a thing!" cried Haidee,
while Val made him fresh tea.  "How <em class="italics">could</em> you
come through Cannes such a sight, Garry?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"What's the matter with me?  I feel good in
these togs.  In future I shall always dress like
this."</p>
<p class="pnext">Haidee shuddered.</p>
<p class="pnext">"You did n't go to Paris after all?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"No, Haidee, I did not go to Paris.  I hired a
bicycle, bought this bicycling suit you don't admire,
and took to the open road.  There isn't any
village between here and Toulon that I haven't
explored inside out, nor any 'café débitant' where
I have n't sampled the chianti or the astispumanti
or anything else that was <em class="italics">tanti</em>."</p>
<p class="pnext">"But what for, Garry?  Why?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"I had some thinking to do," said Garry, "and
I thought I could do it better on a bicycle than in
Paris."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Have you thought about when you're going
to take me in a ship, Daddy?"</p>
<p class="pnext">Bran had climbed on his knee.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Yes; I 've been thinking about that, my son."</p>
<p class="pnext">Haidee said abruptly:</p>
<p class="pnext">"Did n't you say we would take one of those
tramp steamers that go from Marseilles, and touch
at all sorts of ports?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"That was the idea."  Westenra held up a
cigar to Val, and she nodded permission to smoke.
"Why?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Well, as Rupert is going to Morocco next week
I thought we might as well take the same
ship."  Haidee sounded rather breathless.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Ah!" remarked Westenra thoughtfully and lay
back in his chair, his face between the knees of Bran,
who had climbed up into his favourite position.</p>
<p class="pnext">Rupert murmured something about that being
"an idea <em class="italics">bien gentille</em>" and hunted nervously for a
cigarette.</p>
<p class="pnext">"In that case," announced Val quietly, "we
shall all be sailing from Marseilles at much the
same time."</p>
<p class="pnext">"All?"  Every eye was immediately focused upon her.</p>
<p class="pnext">"You----?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"But you 're not coming--"  Haidee broke off
confusedly.</p>
<p class="pnext">"No; but I am leaving France."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Leaving France?" ejaculated Rupert.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Yes, leaving France, and all cities, to go back
to the life I lived as a child and which has been
pulling and calling me ever since."</p>
<p class="pnext">"What, that life in a waggon?" Haidee had
heard of it so often it was strange she should
become so excited about it now.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Yes; a waggon that starts every late afternoon,
and treks throughout the night; and brings you to
a fresh place every morning."  Her face suddenly
lost the veil of shadows that had hung over it so
long.  Space, and joy and distance, and a fierce
wistfulness came into her gaze.  "One goes on and
on to places one has never seen before, sometimes
to places <em class="italics">no one</em> has ever seen before--that is best,
that is wonderful----"</p>
<p class="pnext">Strangely the veil that had passed from her
face seemed to fall upon the faces of her
listeners.  Not one among them but looked curiously
disturbed.</p>
<p class="pnext">"I shall see the wildebeeste grazing on the
horizon once more--and hear the guinea-fowl in the
bush crying 'come back! come back!"</p>
<p class="pnext">Westenra stared at her.  Was this the woman
who had run his nursing home!</p>
<p class="pnext">"Everything in nature, if you leave it alone,
will come back--to the ways of its early life."</p>
<p class="pnext">"If you leave it alone?"  Westenra spoke
almost involuntarily.  She laughed.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Am not I going to be left alone?"</p>
<p class="pnext">There was a silence.  Every one sat staring at her.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Who but I would care for such a foolish life!"
she said more sombrely.</p>
<p class="pnext">"But wouldn't I?" burst out Rupert.  "It is
what I have always longed for.  To <em class="italics">coucher à la
belle étoile</em>!  <em class="italics">Zut, alors</em>!  I will come too.  It is
understood."</p>
<p class="pnext">Val laughed.</p>
<p class="pnext">"You would soon be bored.  One must be a
wanderfoot by birth and instinct."</p>
<p class="pnext">But he repudiated the saying, and there was no
boredom in his eye nor in the eyes of any.  An odd
uneasiness possessed them all.  Haidee looked
paler and was biting her lip.  Bran had descended
from his father's shoulders and advancing on Val
stood looking at her, a startling reflection of her
fierce wistfulness in his own eyes.  But he still
kept a hand on his father's knee.</p>
<p class="pnext">It was Marietta who broke up the séance by
coming out to announce in an autocratic manner
that dinner would be ready in ten minutes.  No
one had realised that it was so late.  Westenra did
not accept the invitation to stay and dine as he
was, but having secured its extension to the
evening sprang on his bicycle and rode for his hotel to
the endangerment of several lives on the <em class="italics">route
Nationale</em>.</p>
<p class="pnext">It hardly seemed an hour before he was back
again, very big and handsome in conventional
dress, among the tranquil trees of the garden.
The place was silvered and transformed by the
light of the moon, which, at the full, hung like a
great luminous pearl on the radiant breast of
heaven.  The windows of the Villa were all set
wide, and in the drawing-room Haidee's fingers
were weaving fairy tales at the piano with such
magic that they seemed real voices and hands that
called and tugged at Val and Rupert under the
trees.  The boy stirred restlessly in his chair,
gripping its sides.  Since dinner Val had been sitting
there, very silent, while Haidee played.</p>
<p class="pnext">When he heard the bell tinkle on the garden gate
far below, and knew that some one, probably
Westenra, was entering, he said suddenly:</p>
<p class="pnext">"I forgot to tell you that the other night when I
walked home with the doctor I happened to
mention to him ... that ... well, that I was with
you at the funeral of Mr. Valdana."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Ah!"  Val sighed strangely and sat up straight
in her chair.  It was too late for anything more to
be said.  Westenra was upon them.  And since
Rupert, vacating his chair, was already on his way
to the drawing-room, it was quite simple and
natural that Westenra should sit down beside her.
They talked, a little disjointedly about the beauty
of the night, how well Haidee played, what a
charming fellow Rupert was.  Then he said
suddenly:</p>
<p class="pnext">"And you are really going back to that wild
wandering life of yours, Val?"</p>
<p class="pnext">It was the first time he had called her Val in all
these years.  She trembled a little, answering
sadly:</p>
<p class="pnext">"Like water, I must return to my own level."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Then you should live on the mountain tops."</p>
<p class="pnext">She trembled again and her heart ached a little
more poignantly.  Why should he mock her?</p>
<p class="pnext">"You think you will be happy?"  His voice was
not mocking, only very gentle.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Oh! happy?" she echoed.  "Who is happy?  But--</p>
<blockquote>
<div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line">'Give me the long white road, and the grey path of the sea,</div>
<div class="line">And the wind's will, and the birds' will, and the heartache</div>
<div class="inner line-block">
<div class="line">still in me,'</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="pfirst">and I will reproach no one."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Reproaching has never been a pastime of
yours, I think--and you may be glad of it, Val, for
reproaches, like curses, have a way of coming home
to roost.  My conscience is no better than an
aviary----"</p>
<p class="pnext">Her involuntary laugh lightened the strain a
little, but Westenra was a thorough man, and
did not mean to leave it at that.  Sombrely he
finished.</p>
<p class="pnext">"I beg your forgiveness, Val, for every reproach
I have ever made you in your capacity as wife,
mother--or lover.  They were undeserved, every one!"</p>
<p class="pnext">Why should his voice have grown hoarse at the
last, and her heart come climbing up into her
throat as if to suffocate her?  It was some
moments before she could half-whisper, half-mutter a
response.</p>
<p class="pnext">"You are too generous; I deserved everything
you ever said--but after long thinking I see--that--we
cannot all win out as wives and mothers.  Of
some of us, when you 've said we are good lovers
you 've said all.  I hoped I was a good mother
too--but it is plain that I am not, for Bran,
even Bran on whom I had staked my last
throw--even Bran leaves me--"</p>
<p class="pnext">Strange that Haidee should choose this moment
to launch forth into the first trembling plaintive
notes of the 17th Sonata, that wonderful pæan of
terror and beauty under whose rushing spell seven
and a half years agone Val had lain her face against
her husband's and shared with him the greatest,
sweetest secret that can ever lie between man and
woman!</p>
<p class="pnext">"Bran shall never leave you--if you will have
me with him--or even if you will not."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Garrett--what are you saying?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"'The years teach much that the days never
know.'  Val, I have realised during the last seven
days what I have been learning ever since you
came into my life, that everything is worthless
but the love and happiness of the woman you
love."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Oh, Joe!" she cried in great humility and
wonder.  "You with all your gifts of mind and
brain; with all you have done for science, and still
will do----!"</p>
<p class="pnext">"It can all go to the devil," he said cheerfully.
"I 'm coming to live with you in a waggon on the
veldt, to see the wildebeeste, whatever they may
be, grazing on the horizon, and hear the guinea-fowl
calling from the bush.  These things have got
a hold on my imagination and will never let go.
And if I can't do something for science, even out
there on the veldt, I 'm a poor sort of fellow and
will deserve to be forgotten."</p>
<p class="pnext">"But the rewards you have already won--that
are just within your grasp?--the chair at
Columbia--the Nobel--the--"  (She herself set no
store by such things, but well she knew how
men value them more than their immortal souls.)</p>
<p class="pnext">"Too bad!" said Westenra, with an ironical
smile.  "Did you ever hear of what John
L. Sullivan said the day after his defeat at New
Orleans?  A sympathiser came wheedling up to
him, saying: 'It's too bad, Jawn!  Too bad!
What 'll you do now?'  Sullivan, real man that he
always was, even in defeat, growled back at him:
'What 'll I do now?  Pugh!  <em class="italics">Ain't I John L. Sullivan
still?</em>'  Pretty good philosophy for a pug,
Val!  I can only say in all humility--same here!
Even in defeat I----"</p>
<p class="pnext">His words were cut short by a very whirlwind of
lace and tears and laughter.  A pair of arms were
thrown round Val's neck, and a sobbing, happy
voice cried, loud enough for all who wished to
hear:</p>
<p class="pnext">"Oh, Val--I love you, and I beg your pardon.
I am a pig from away back--and a cat and a
beast--but oh!  I am so happy!  Rupert and I
are going to get married to-morrow, and after we
have been in Morocco a little we shall come out
and join you in your waggon."</p>
<p class="pnext">Westenra stood up big and grim in the moonlight.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Hell's blood and blazes!--and is <em class="italics">this</em> the way I
am thrown down at the eleventh or any moment?--bring
me the bridegroom, and I 'll eat him up at
one mouthful.  I 'll beat the gizzard out of him--I'll----"</p>
<p class="pnext">"<em class="italics">M'voilà, Monsieur le Docteur</em>!  Here I am,"
said Rupert, not without dignity, and with great
goodwill.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Well, get out," said Westenra softly, "and take
your bride to be with you.  That's all that's
required of you for the time being."</p>
<p class="pnext">He cared not how they went nor where, so long
as he was alone once more with this only woman of
his life.  He took her hand in his and drew her
close until her cheek lay against his as on a
long-ago night, driving up Broadway to 68th Street.
Before them, through the trees, glimmered a silver
expanse of water, with grim warships lying at
rest and little red-sailed fishing boats rocking
softly.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Heart of my heart--does n't this seem to you
a fair sea on which to launch a new ship of
dreams."</p>
<p class="pnext">"No.  Not a new ship, Joe.  The same old
ship.  I have never been out of it for an hour, or
a moment."</p>

<p class="pfirst">Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>
<p class="pnext">Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™'s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will remain
freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future generations. To

<h4 class="level-4 pfirst section-title title">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</h4>
<p class="pfirst">Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing
the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely
distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of
equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to
$5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status
with the IRS.</p>
<p class="pnext">The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a class="reference external" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate">http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate</a></p>
<p class="pnext">While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>
<p class="pnext">International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>
<p class="pnext">Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

<p class="pfirst">Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg™
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</p>
<p class="pnext">Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the
U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>
<p class="pnext">Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.</p>
<p class="pnext">Corrected <em class="italics">editions</em> of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number. The replaced older file is
renamed. <em class="italics">Versions</em> based on separate sources are treated as new
eBooks receiving new filenames and etext numbers.</p>
